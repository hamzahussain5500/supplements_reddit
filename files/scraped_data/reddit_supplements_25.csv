submission,1kv92e2,,3,My tongkat ali experience.,1.0,,"Long story short. I am a 25 yr old male, who has had a few symptoms of low T. Went to a doctor, had my bloodwork done and everything came back in the green along with my T levels showing around 300 which the doctor said is within ‚Äúnormal range‚Äù. Symptoms included ED, anxiety, low libido, low mood & no energy.

Thought fuck it, before i apply for trt in a private clinic i thought id try tongkat ali after doing research to see if the boost on testosterone would make a difference, and fuck me it has.

This is my 5th day taking 3% tongkat ali, and the effects are insane. Rock hard erections to where i dont need to rely on tadalafil anymore, no brain fog, crazy energy (even on 3 hours sleep i wake up feeling energised as fuck, crazy libido (back to 3-5 rounds a day), and my anxiety is almost non existent. Feel really positive and do not stress at all compared to how i was before overthinking about everything and getting stressed out. This stuff is absolutely insane. I know its real stuff since i took 800mg instead of the recommended 400mg dose and got nauseous. My standard is taking 1 400mg pill every morning. A game changer. If this is what tongkat ali does, cant even imagine what trt would do. 

Useless doctors calls for taking your own actions to improve your wellbeing. Absolute joke of a care system in the UK, had to fight to get a bloodtest after 10 years which was first rejected because i am not 45 years old. After explaining that a 25 yr old should not even have a hint of ED, he finally understood and got my bloodwork done.

Originally I did the test with my doctor and he said ‚Äúyour vitamin D is a bit low get a supplement‚Äù and got one for 400iu that did fuck all.

I later paid for a private test and found out actually my vitamin D was ‚Äúcritically low‚Äù - cheers GP for letting me know lol. I started on a regimen of injections at 120,000iu and only then did I start to get some energy and feel better - my D is now sufficient but I still need to get it optimal and hoping for further improvements.

As others have said also check for deficiency in B vitamins, iron, etc.

When starting supplements I would also recommend starting one at a time rather than going balls to the wall with all of them. That way you‚Äôll know what‚Äôs working and what could also be exasperating your symptoms.

For example, when I first started taking vitamin d I was taking a supplement with k2 and felt worse, fatigued, insomnia awful. I tried D without K and no issues. This may be different for you. Try each thing one at a time for a few days before adding something new. You may tolerate some and not others and some may add to your symptoms.

I would also look into other potential causes for example gut issues and food intolerances - you can do a test to check for common allergens and gluten, etc, which could also contribute to your symptoms.

Also, how is your mental health? Unchecked depression and anxiety are also big contributors to low energy, fatigue and brain fog. 

Otherwise I would look at adding a good B complex and probably zinc (balanced with copper) to your stack for now.",Capital_Self1758,1748193078.0,,,,

submission,1kv5rni,,1,Thiamine CAUSING bloating and constipation?,1.0,,"I just started taking low dose Life Extensions Benfotiamine w/ Thiamine HCl. I‚Äôm breaking the capsule into quarters and creating my own capsules that contain approx 25mg of benfotiamine and 6mg of thiamine hcl only once a day. Within 24 hours of taking it I started noticing severe bloating and then slow motility resulting in constipation. I stuck with it for about 4-5 days and then stopped taking it to see if it would go away and it did after about 48 hours of not taking it.

I have chronic gut issues and a plethora of other health issues I‚Äôm trying to address. I also have homozygous MTHFR gene mutation which complicates things. I keep reading how much B1 helps people with bloating, slow motility, and constipation, however I‚Äôm not seeing much about B1 causing it.

submission,1kv4pkl,,1,new to supplements in general. absorption question.,1.0,,"hello! 

I have never been one to take vitamins or supplements but. I'm getting older, my body and health are changing, ya know. I'd like to start now, at least with a few of them. my hair has gone through a traumatic event, and my skin is struggling. I started having issues with, what looks like psoriasis but isnt, so. I would like to give it a boost if I can. (I also have a derm appointment in June)

how does absorption work? I know theres no way I'm absorbing the entire amount right? they say to take with food - is that to help with an upset stomach or does taking it with food help the absorption process? 

more specifically, these collagen & biotin gummies I'm taking; how can I ensure I'm absorbing as much as possible? it's 100mg collagen/2500 mcg biotin (as d-Bioton) 

I could take a photo of the supplement facts if needed. 

feel free to tell me if I'm not understanding things properly or not on the right track. I'm just a noob. thanks in advance. ü´∂üèª",Longjumping-Row1434,1748185514.0,8,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kv4pkl/new_to_supplements_in_general_absorption_question/

I am not diagnosed anorexic or bulimic, but I do have very disordered eating; I don't eat as I should, and I'm aware of that, but it's been a life long issue. I do eat daily, I don't binge/purge. it's mostly I just eat one meal (which takes me hours to full finish) and then I pick at stuff later in the day. I take prescribed vitamin D and b12, and vitamin C as I had deficiencies in all of the above after extensive blood tests. never been diagnosed with low protein but my blood tests point to lower than typical protein.

the skin issues started after I had already been taking all of that, along with dizziness/fainting (including one occurrence that busted my head open) and hematuria. my doctor ran all of the tests, and checked you know vitamin levels and whatnot. I recognize I likely have more issues than something that can be rectified with supplements, and I do see regular doctors/specialists while we try and figure out what's going on. but I still would like to improve my hair, skin, and my nails. 

my nails have always been weak, and they chip & peel. my hair used to be very healthy but I ended up having to cut it all off (about 18 inches) and I would like to promote growth and thickness. and my skin, besides the skin issues that arose, is constantly dry and peeling. mostly on my hands/fingers.

(I'm sorry, idk the best way to phrase that.) I wear a size 10 jeans, L in shirts yk what I mean. I am lactose sensitive so I don't drink milk, but I do eat cheese, yogurt, and cottage cheese pretty often. 

the cause of hematuria is unknown at this point. at first they said it was due to a kidney stone, the first one of my life and no history of UTIs or kidney infection, but I passed it and it's still happening. I have ongoing appointments with urology; I have upcoming appointments for a CT with contrast and a cystoscopy. I also have appointments with cardiology for a heart monitor for the fainting. 

the skin issues that came up look like psoriasis plaques - they're round with uneven edges, scaly/shiny - but they're only on my legs, and mostly only on the backs of my legs. I have dry patches on my face as well but they look different and behave differently than what's on my legs. my nails peel from the top, down. like mostly just the first few millimeters of my nails, it doesn't peel the whole length. they bend easily too; not very strong at all. 

I personally have a sneaking suspicion I have an autoimmune disorder, which I've been asking to be tested for, for about 6 years now.

I'd love to hear your experience or knowledge on the following:

What specific foods helped you (or someone you know) increase hemoglobin and iron levels?

What combinations improve iron absorption (especially for non-heme sources)?

What foods or drinks should be avoided or spaced out to not interfere with iron intake?

Have you used any natural supplements like Floradix, iron-rich infusions, or herbal support?

Any special considerations for breastfeeding moms recovering from anemia?

I speculate that if someone feels a high difference from taking it, maybe they were lacking in some minerals/trace minerals before so this is having a noticeable impact. I see it as more of a long game; nourishing my body over time, giving it an absorbable, natural powerhouse of a substance.",itsgoodtobe_alive,1748160693.0,,,,

Is this a good brand?

To be honest, this price on Toniiq is even cheaper than ProHealth, that sells powder for 100 1,000mg servings for $50 which is the best deal, but still.

Recently, though, I started coming up with fictional stories that work as a ""fanservice to myself"", having episodes of euphoria. That happened during my entire life, but lasted a day or two, with a relief from that euphoria upon writing or drawing said stories.

But now I've been like that for a week, stories won't stop coming to mind, euphoria strikes every night and I feel like I'm ON DRUGS.

I take psychiatric medications as well but the only thing that is new is that supplement.

submission,1kur4pn,,1,BPH vs Prostatitis vs Pelvic Floor Dysfunction,0.67,,"A surprising number of men are misdiagnosed with BPH, prostatitis, or pelvic floor disfunction. Let‚Äôs break down the key differences between these common urinary related diagnoses:

 

---

 

**Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)** 

* Non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate 

* Common in men over 50 

* Symptoms include slow stream, incomplete emptying of blader, and frequent urination 

* Typically worsens over time 

* Treatments: alpha-blockers, 5-ARIs, lifestyle changes, sometimes surgery

 

**Prostatitis** 

* Inflammation of the prostate 

* Can be bacterial (acute/chronic) or non-bacterial (chronic pelvic pain syndrome) 

* Often affects younger men too 

* Symptoms: burning urination, pelvic pain, sometimes flu-like symptoms 

* Treatment depends on the type (antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, pelvic therapy)

 

**Pelvic Floor Dysfunction** 

* Often *totally overlooked* 

* The muscles that support your bladder, bowel, and prostate become tight or weak 

* Symptoms: urinary frequency, hesitancy, pain ‚Äî almost identical to BPH 

* Frequently misdiagnosed 

* Treatment: physical therapy, biofeedback, breathing exercises

 

---

 

Here‚Äôs the kicker: a 2019 study in the *International Urogynecology Journal* found that **up to 50% of men diagnosed with chronic prostatitis actually had pelvic floor dysfunction** instead. [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-019-03935-y)

comment,mu389l3,1kuopza,7,,,0,"Well, hangovers seemed to cause anxiety, but then more alcohol later, would help me to relax and get over it... :D 

In all seriousness though, I've had more than a few PTSD occasions in my life. Was born in a country where terrorism was going on - watched my father cry hearing of murdered friends... spent 4 years on strict bedrest as a child while being treated for several illnesses at once, got better... learned how to walk - got into an occupation where as luck would have it, have been shot at, was a first responder to a young man shot in the head but still breathing... and a whole lot of other things.

So I've had anxiety which I have tried to hide from others, although shortly after my father passed away, I experienced panic attacks, although the first and second time, I had no clue that was what it was called... 

I learned to mostly manage things on my own but still had anxiety that I tried to hide and just ""deal with"" but couldn't really rid myself of it.

I started taking NAC (but for other reasons) a few years ago, as well as Ashwaganda and Pine Bark Extract. I have noticed an enormous decrease in anxiety symptoms over time since taking those. I am not sure I can scientifically claim any or all helped - but I can say there appears to be a correlation.   
  
I had also started Magnesium about 8 years ago, and I did notice a very slight improvement but it alone did not give me great relief but it did have other benefits I noticed (reduced muscle cramping).",Scottopolous,1748129989.0,,,,

2. If no stomach discomfort, and you are still alive, try 1200 mg. 

Stop being afraid of some discomfort. Your anxiety is likely greater than the discomfort, no?

submission,1kulqwe,,3,Valerian root - makes me anxious and dizzy the next day.,0.72,,"
Two capsules are suggested for bedtime. 
The one time I took two, I was literally in bed all day, feeling sick, dizzy and lightheadedness. It caused me a lot of anxiety.

I came close to pitching the bottle. The brand in question is HealthFare. 3000 mg

Thursday, I took one capsule, slept decent, but still felt some of the above things, and ended up taking meclizine for the dizziness. I did some errands during the day, but was very anxious. And couldn't wait to get back home.

I have a bottle of NOW brand 500 mg valerian root. But I'm nervous. Suggested is two, which would equal 1000 mg.

Is Valerian root not a good supplement for me?",heyitsmejomomma,1748120506.0,10,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kulqwe/valerian_root_makes_me_anxious_and_dizzy_the_next/

submission,1kuampn,,236,L-Theanine is working again after 3 years!!!,0.95,,"**Hi, I‚Äôm Christian (42, Netherlands). I have PDA, ADD and Asperger‚Äôs, and I was sick for over 30 years.**

After a long and difficult journey, I managed to resolve several major health issues, including:  
- IBS-D  
- Leaky gut  
- SIBO (H‚ÇÇS)  
- Pellagra  
- MTHFR-related problems  

For years, I relied on **L-theanine** ‚Äî around 350 mg, 3‚Äì4 times per day. It worked great, almost like oxazepam. But after solving my SIBO, the theanine slowly stopped working. Within two weeks, the calming effect vanished. I assumed it was tolerance or homeostasis, so I paused it for a month ‚Äî but even after switching brands or combining it with caffeine, nothing helped. I had to go back to benzos.

**Fast forward 3 years** ‚Äî I no longer need benzos.  
My **serotonin** was back online, but my **dopamine** was still flatlined. Tyrosine, DLPA, NALT ‚Äî nothing worked. So I dug deeper.

---

### Clue #1: Heart palpitations & tryptophan

I noticed heart palpitations that disappeared after taking 333 mg **tryptophan**. That led me to think of **NAD** deficiency. I had a history of pellagra and was already taking **niacinamide (B3)** ‚Äî but I didn‚Äôt realize how closely it tied into the **NAD cycle** and **tryptophan depletion**.

So I started combining:  
**‚Üí 500 mg B3 + 333 mg tryptophan daily**  
When I noticed tryptophan converting to **melatonin** again, I knew my NAD levels were coming back.

---

### Clue #2: B6 ‚Äî both forms

Still no effect from theanine. I checked my **B6 status** ‚Äî both **pyridoxine (inactive)** and **PLP (active)** are critical for neurotransmitter synthesis. Increasing both helped *a little*, but didn‚Äôt fix it.

---

### Clue #3: Dopamine cofactors ‚Äî the missing link

Eventually I reviewed *all* the dopamine cofactors ‚Äî not just B6 or vitamin C. I found multiple imbalances. Especially **vitamin C**, which turned out to be *very* low. After correcting the full picture...

**BOOM ‚Äî theanine worked again.**

---

### Conclusion: If L-theanine suddenly stops working, consider this checklist:

1. **Take a break** ‚Äî could be tolerance  
2. **Try a different brand**, or combine with **caffeine**  
3. If that fails, go deeper:  
  - Check **NAD status** (B3 + tryptophan)  
  - Check **B6 levels** ‚Äî both pyridoxine and PLP  
  - Check **all dopamine cofactors** ‚Äî not just C  
    *(think: iron, copper, folate, magnesium, etc.)*  
  - Support **dopamine metabolism** ‚Äî it‚Äôs a system  

If dopamine isn‚Äôt being made properly, theanine often won‚Äôt work.

---

**Hope this helps someone!**

What is SIBO??

If you‚Äôre open to allopathic medicine, I am a huge believer in Sodium Valproate. It needs to be this version of Valproic acid,  the extended release version. Valproic acid is merely a derivative of  Valerian root, so it‚Äôs not really the most unnatural form of medicine, though it is prescribed at very high dosages. The derivative was needed to improve absorption and effectiveness, something they Valerian root simply could not live up to.

Anyway I just wanna say man you're a brilliant guy very clearly and I'm having fun reading your replies to people.  

Also to the guy struggling with lack of happiness and fucked up brain chemistry I understand you throughly and im sorry you gotta go through that right now, I come from a long line of mental illness, unfortunately often severe and debilitating mental illness that has ended my father's life and far too many more.  I hope you persevere through, which you absolutely CAN so make no mistake about that.  ""Install"" surtain points in your brain, and repeat them all day to ensure the development of a helpful and reassuring mindset, such as that these feelings are temporary and in no way permanent.  Under no circumstance are you a victim to anything, because you will do what you gotta do to figure this shit out and find personal contentment, fulfillment and happiness.  People who exist through real struggle and make it to the other side of it have a leg up on the rest of folks, keep these thoughts close at all times, repeat them and believe them.

I've fallen down a rabbit hole with this and things that help me without medication include: a probiotic on an empty stomach each morning with water (helps regulate dopamine throughout the day with a healthier baseline), bilberry extract (reduces neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, which ADHD brains are more susceptible to - also helps with memory), vitamin b12 (helps with a calmer mind and memory). 

Additionally, good quality/quantity sleep is a priority each night, a lot of walking, protein, exercise a few days a week (in the morning, again for dopamine and energy regulation), avoiding too many processed foods generally, and timing my caffeine right.

But calling acupuncture ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù and claiming it's not evidence based just isn‚Äôt accurate, my friend.There‚Äôs actually a solid and growing body of peer reviewed research that shows real physiological and clinical effects.

Take ADHD, for example. A 2024 systematic review published in evidence based complementary and alternative medicine found that acupuncture and electroacupuncture showed meaningful improvements in ADHD symptoms in kids and teens. The researchers did call for more high quality studies, but the results were strong enough to indicate legitimate benefit. Also, in 2022, the nature schizophrena research published a study showing that TEAS (transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation) helped reduce core ADHD symptoms and improved blood flow to the prefrontal cortex after just four weeks.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40086639
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-022-01914-0

There's also evidence for gallbladder related shoulder pain. A 2013 trial published in Zhen Ci Yan Jiu showed thaat acupuncture at the GB21 point led to a 90 percent remision rate in pain related to gallbladder dysfunction, compared to 56.67 percent in the control group. Even a 2022 paper in The Journal of Advances in Gastroenterology and Hepatology backed that up, showing that stimulation of gallbladder meridian points helped relieve referred pain.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23342781
https://jajgastrohepto.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/JJGH-v9-1763.pdf

For anxiety, a 2021 meta analysis published in Annals of General Psychiatry loked at 20 studies with over 1,800 participants and concluded that acupuncture significantly reduced anxiety symptoms versus placebo. A 2023 review in Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice also found it to be effective in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, especially for people who don‚Äôt do well with meds.
https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-021-00327-5
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36626458

If you‚Äôre talking about muscle or joint pain, particularly shoulder issues, there‚Äôs research there too. A 2024 study in Integrative Medicine Research found that people who received acupuncture had better pain relief, range of motion, and quality of life than those who got sham treatment. And a 2023 analysis in the Journal of Pain Research reviewed 22 years of global studies and concluded that acupuncture is consistently among the most effective non drug treatments for shoulder pain.
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213422024000295
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10024538

Now, on your point that ‚Äúscience isn‚Äôt regional‚Äù you‚Äôre right. But the way science is funded, published, and perceived is absolutely influenced by geography and bias. High quality studies from China, Korea, and Japan often get ignored or downplayed in the West, not because they‚Äôre poorly done, but because they don‚Äôt come from Western institutions or fit familiar models. That‚Äôs not a reflection of the data, it‚Äôs a reflection of the gatekeeping.

Even the NIH recognized acupuncture‚Äôs clinical value back in 1997, especially for post op nausea and chronic pain. And many Western countries, including Germany, Australia, and the UK, have added acupuncture to national treatment guidelines for migraines, back pain, and tension type headaches.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3611641
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8270485

So yeah, it‚Äôs not a cure all and it deserves scrutiny like any other medical approach. But writing it off entirely as fake or useless doesn‚Äôt reflect what the evidence actually shows. That‚Äôs just rejection by your lack of critical thinking.

To top it all off, I have had personal experience of my ADHD symptoms improving significantly, even when my excersise, diet, and lifestyle remains the same. I even suffered with gallbladder pain that radiated behind my right shohlder blade for roughly 12 years and acupuncture got rid of it. Even my fiance under great stress from work and constant worrying about her life significantly improved after a few sessions. My uncle had pain in his shoulder for 15 yeats roughly if i remember correcly that went away after one session he said. There's no way that's a placebo or..

Also, sure, we started with ADHD, but you came in claiming acupuncture is ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù across the board. That opens the door to discuss its broader clinical relevance, including gallbladder related pain and electrostimulation, which are very much part of the acupuncture landscape and well documented in the literature that I shared.

1. Make sure your form is good¬†

5. Ensure you have proper recovery time between lifts


I've had knee pain for a decade, tried PT(maybe tiny bit of benefit but it's stuff you can literally Google like the stretches I mentioned), looked into PRP and based on the research it's most bullshit, people do benefit from cortisone shots but I think this would be near the last resort well after you try for a long time to fix it.

comment,mu4bjnp,1ku6h84,1,,,0,"Twice in my life have had knee problems. The first was a vague grinding if I was doing stairmaster or walking a lot of stairs.

I started fish oil and it completely disappeared for decades, seriously - gone. Its also of course good a host of other things including, cardiac and skin health.

More recently I have been diagnosed with osteo arthritis in both knees.

I have a little pain gong up and down stairs but worst is if I have been driving for more than 30 mins and then get out of the can it takes maybe 100 steps for the joints to loosen up and pain to disappear.

I just used a rolled up towel to rest my leg against so it was straight instead of angled in the car and that meant zero pain when I would get out. It was crazy how easily it was addressed. Maybe angling the knee that way creates inflammation over time.

Apart from fish oil I started taking curcumin (has to be highly bioavailable - containing piperine OR will say something on the label about being highly bioavailable) and glucosamine.

AND I started Collagen TYPE II. Types 1 and III are for skin, hair, nails etc, type specifically is for joints and ligaments so make sure its the right kind.

I use Jarrow Type II Collagen and Blackmores Glucosamine and Curcumin  - Blackmores is an Aussie brand, and have noticed difference after couple months of those and also strengthening my legs.

Knee braces are not always an answer for knee pain e.g. for OA it can compress the knee and be worse not better for it, so you need to know exactly what the pro0blem is by seeing a medical professional;.

comment,mtyu06m,1ku4gpt,3,,,0,"This is more common than ppl realize after stopping 5-HTP. I experienced it when I stopped taking 5-HTP for almost a month. Your serotonin system is still recalibrating. When you supplement serotonin precursors for a while, your brain can dial down its own production. So when you stop, it can leave you feeling flat, numb, low libido‚Äîexactly like you're describing.

For most people, this starts to lift within 2‚Äì4 weeks, sometimes sooner. If you were taking a high dose or for a long time, it might take a bit longer. Your brain just needs time to re-establish its own rhythm.

I would try:

Magnesium and B6 (support serotonin production)

Avoiding alcohol or anything else that could mess with brain chemistry

SAM-E could help mood and libido but wouldnt be good if you're feeling overly stimulated

KSM66 could be good for libido and energy (its a form of ashwagandha)

And the tyrosine we talked about could be good if you're feeling emotionally flat but not if you're feeling stimulated already

I‚Äôve been taking Thorne Basic Nutrients 2/Day and really appreciate the quality‚Äîespecially the use of highly bioavailable forms like methylated B-vitamins, chelated minerals, and active forms of vitamin D, K2, etc.

However, Thorne is quite pricey over the long run. I‚Äôm looking for a daily multivitamin with similar high-quality, bioavailable ingredients (e.g. methylcobalamin, 5-MTHF, chelated minerals), but at a more affordable price point.

Does anyone have recommendations for a solid alternative brand that:

	‚Ä¢	Uses methylated or active forms (B12 as methylcobalamin, folate as 5-MTHF)
	‚Ä¢	Contains a good range of essential nutrients (not under-dosed)
	‚Ä¢	Has clean ingredients (no unnecessary fillers, dyes, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Is trusted for quality and absorption
	‚Ä¢	Costs less than Thorne in the long run

Brands like Pure Encapsulations, NOW, Life Extension, Jarrow, Seeking Health, etc. are on my radar, but I‚Äôd love to hear your actual experiences.

Thanks in advance!

NOW Adam and Eve both use folic acid instead of methylfolate. The rest of the vitamins and minerals seem good though.

Seeking Health is good but it's not that much cheaper than Thorne. It seems like one pill of Thorne Basic has more or less around the same dosages as the Seeking Health Multivitamin One. The Thorne half dose would end up being cheaper per serving than Seeking Health.

comment,mu0cgew,1ku0q5b,2,,,2,"Life Extension contains bioavailable forms, too. It's just some are mixed with less desirable forms: e.g. B6 uses both pyridoxine HCl and P5P, selenium uses 3 forms including sodium selenite which has lower bioavailability. 

It also has magnesium oxide but honestly, I tend to ignore magnesium in multivitamins because it's either the bad form or so low that it's negligible.

The SNS Multi XT the other poster mentioned looks good, too, but it's around the same price as Thorne for the full dose.

I've been comparing various multivitamins and to be honest, if you want only the good forms, Thorne's pricing is actually not bad particularly if taking just half the recommended serving.

comment,mtx69jh,1ktvqu1,12,,,1,"The black niece comment doesn‚Äôt help you here. Lots of racists have minority relatives. But I‚Äôm in psych and people can have intrusive thoughts for anything, the intrusive thought doesn‚Äôt mean you are racist but ocd happens to have grabbed a racist idea and ran with it. Other people with ocd have an invasive thought of pedophilia or rape, doesn‚Äôt mean they are pedophiles. It just means it‚Äôs a sketchy thing that feedback loops into this anxiety cycle

You have that one supplement everyone is suggesting NAC. 

Assuming you are already getting the standard of care which is Exposure and response prevention with or without cbt. Plus the serotonin modulating meds we aren‚Äôt allowed to mention on this sub since they are prescribed. Following that it is getting rid of anxiety provoking supplements, behaviors, or meds, and adding NAC. 

Some people only find NAC helps with the flairs and then they basically build a ‚Äútolerance‚Äù.  For health you could take it daily, but for the intrusive thoughts you might find it works better punctuated. Omega 3s can also make some meds more effective. And then ocd flairs can also be triggered by stress, which includes inflammation. So if it‚Äôs worse when you are getting over an illness, sleep deprived, allergies, then taking anti inflammatory supps like moringa or broccoli sprouts, turmeric with black pepper could be useful. 

I‚Äôd also ignore the internalized racism aspect, while it‚Äôs true that the unclean minorities is an idea that came from society and was internalized, that won‚Äôt tell you why you obsess over it, and it does nothing to help you treat it, ruminating on it could easily worsen it. There is good neurological mapping for this kind of thing. A pmhnp nurse, or psychiatrist will be your best bet; a psychologist can‚Äôt balance the meds but they can do the ERP/CBT side.

comment,mtxnnlx,1ktvqu1,-4,,,1,"u/Little4nt is right. This is still racist and having a black niece doesn‚Äôt make a difference. You are better off acknowledging it straight on. Some part of your subconscious mind/OCD latched on to the ‚Äúdirty Mexican/dirty black person‚Äù stereotype in our culture. *It is not intentional*, but your OCD is triggered by race and that is racist. It is something you‚Äôre aware of and working on. 

I promise, you will get a better response from most people if you take this approach. There will still be people who don‚Äôt understand and are angry or hurt. Leave them be. You know you don‚Äôt *want* to be this way. Most people will prefer your candor if the topic comes up. 

As for your niece, has this impacted her? Kids pick up on a lot of subtle things, even when we think they‚Äôre too young or are doing a good job of hiding it. It‚Äôs already difficult to have a multiracial family at times and this adds to it. (Not that you would ever intentionally hurt your niece.) I don‚Äôt know a lot about OCD, but learning more about anti-racism may help you better understand racism and how to talk about it with more nuance, benefitting you, your niece and other people in your life.

What you can do is: 
Get vitamin d levels checked.

Increase Protein intake to 1g per lbs lean mass plus 50g and I mean DIASS 90+ value, no rice, no lentils, no wheat counted towards this goal.
Just meat, eggs, dairy and soy (algea and hemp ig too but nobody eats meaningful amounts of those really).
But if you are vegan or vegetarian and you can't reach higher than DIASS 80 eat another 20-30g protein on top. 

However if you wanna trial such a high intake you should have higher basal intake of food calcium as well. 

Carb cycle properly if you lose weight or increase carbs if you can handle that (while dieting or maintaining). 
When I fuck up even just 2 days of eating my joints get eviscerated at work, your joints need the glycogen to cussion properly.

Maintain good transient electrolyte status and this is tricky but this is as important as glycogen. 
What I mean with transient is dont dump a whole bunch of potassium or sodium at once into your body but rather have both with a fair ratio of each other multiple times a day.

I was on SSRIs for a few months some time ago, but I'm no longer taking them.

Could this lack of enjoyment be related to low dopamine levels? I‚Äôd appreciate your insight.

comment,mtz5sni,1ktouja,2,,,0,"**You're Already Winning‚ÄîBut Fighting the Wrong Battle**

At 33, you've mastered the fundamentals that most people never figure out: discipline, consistency, physical excellence. Your supplement stack shows you understand optimization. Your workout routine proves you can execute. You've got the energy to work non-stop. That's not the problem.

**The SSRI Truth**
You were right to get off the SSRIs. They didn't fix anything‚Äîthey just muted your internal compass. Now you're feeling again, but you're feeling the emptiness where purpose should be.

**Your Dopamine Question**
Yes, this could be dopamine-related, but not how you think. Your brain is wired for achievement and challenge‚Äîthat's why you excel at work and workouts. But leisure activities? Movies? Small talk? Your high-performance brain finds them unstimulating because they don't connect to anything meaningful.

**The Selective Focus Reality**
You can work non-stop because work has clear metrics and outcomes. You can't enjoy hanging out with friends because there's no mission attached. This isn't a bug‚Äîit's a feature of a goal-oriented mind that needs bigger targets.

**Your Real Supplement Stack**
Your body is optimized. Now optimize your purpose. You need something that makes your current success a stepping stone, not the destination. Why are you getting jacked? Why are you building wealth? Why are you developing discipline?

**The 33-Year-Old Window**
You're at the perfect age where you've built capability but haven't yet locked into a legacy. This restlessness isn't depression‚Äîit's your potential demanding expression.

**Stop Supplementing Symptoms**
No amount of NMN or L-theanine will fix a purpose deficiency. Find something worth building that's bigger than your current wins. Make your discipline serve something that matters beyond yourself.

Your discipline is your superpower. Now point it at something that makes your current success look like warm-up sets.",Titanstrike_0999,1748074011.0,,,,

IMHO the only way to find what works for you is to try stuff with an open mind and understand everyone‚Äôs journey (and biochemical state) is different. 

The classic mood lifters are 5HTP / tryptophan vitamin d and vitamin b complex. Also exercise and real sun light usually help. 

Personally I think the minerals we need in large quantities are often worth ago as well. Get an electrolytes supplement and see if that helps. Sea salt is great, as is potassium and even sodium bicarbonate can lift mood.",chopperear,1748075927.0,,,,

Some research suggests there could be some harm to liver and blood sugar/insulin management with the right combo in the right dose.

Otherwise, when I'm concerned someone is taking too many supplements, it's usually more from a practical point of view. It's difficult to have so many variables in play and manage them well, while also ensuring you have a strong understanding of what each product is really doing for your health.

It‚Äôs literally the fastest growing cause of liver injury here in the states. Even if you aren‚Äôt taking something dangerous or in dangerous amounts that is causing serious damage, anything that‚Äôs metabolized by the liver and isn‚Äôt necessary is something best to avoid.

comment,mtu1q73,1ktigih,25,,,0,Just watch out for a paradoxical reaction over time. I had a good experience the first week taking Magnesium glycinate but after a week developed terrible insomnia and somatic anxiety. This reaction is rare but worth knowing about just in case. I suffered for a month before I figured it out. Now 10 days after stopping I am finally feeling better and sleeping though the night again. I took the Mag Gly equivalent to 200mg elemental magnesium for migraine and it did help with that and now they are getting worse again as its is out of my system. I will probably try a different form of Magnesium next time but previously took magnesium citrate with no noticeable benefits or side effects.

 'Oh 60% Elemental! Its the best!'
When thats far from the case. It's the worst by far for bioavailability & gut issues. Bisglycinate Chelate buffered is by far the best form of magnesium and should be the golden standard.

**The Android version is finally live.**¬†üéâ

Massive thanks to everyone who tested early builds or gave feedback‚Äîit genuinely shaped the app.

I‚Äôd talked about the app before, and you wanted me to update you when it dropped on Android. For anyone who missed the last post:

I originally built this for myself to optimize my supplement intake.

The app creates a daily schedule based on your stack and tries to optimize around:

* **Ideal timing**¬†(morning vs evening, pre/post meal)
* **Interactions**¬†(things that cancel each other out)
* **Synergies**¬†(stuff that boosts other stuff)
* **Fasting windows**
* **Cycling**¬†(if you cycle creatine, ashwagandha, etc.)

The iOS version‚Äôs been live for a little over a month. It started as a personal side project, but it‚Äôs grown fast‚Äîmostly thanks to the feedback and support from communities like this one.

**‚úÖ Recent updates (thanks to your feedback):**

* Added 10+ new supplements
* **Cycling mode**
* **Insights page**¬†with logs, adherence rates, streaks
* **Schedule explanations**¬†‚Üí understand¬†*why*¬†each supp is placed where it is

**üõ†Ô∏è Currently working on:**

* Add custom supplements (finally!)
* Better planning around coffee/tea
* Cost breakdowns (per dose, monthly cost, etc.)

This started as a personal tool, but now it's growing thanks to this community. If you have ideas or requests‚Äîdrop them here. I read everything

Big thanks again to the sub, your support honestly made me want to double down and keep improving it!

comment,mtvlo7z,1ktgfok,1,,,2,"The reason ssri's do this is that you have introduced a powerful drug into the bloodstream. So the body will crave more food to try to break it up and out. 

Another reason is that it's powerful. It depletes the serotonin receptor a hell of a lot faster. The drug is designed to pass the blood-brain barrier at a rapid rate. 

Once you have depleted serotonin one of the major ways you can get it back is by eating healthy. Not to say 5htp doesn't pass the blood-brain barrier also but the SSRI does a lot more depletion to the brain. 

Another thing is a lack of serotonin can cause stress and that in turn can also cause you to eat more in the wake of trying to fix it.",hcseven,1748023916.0,,,,

for me, the supplement that tastes the worst is NAC, which often has a rotten egg smell. i tried one bottle of it and stopped taking it because of that smell, it does seem to have good health effects but having to smell rotten eggs each day isn't worth those effects. the smell makes sense though because it's sulfur-based, like eggs, stinkbombs, etc. -- and the interesting part is that from reviews of NAC, i gather that the worse it smells, the fresher and higher quality it is, some people judge the quality of the supplement by how terrible it smells.",rinkuhero,1747995247.0,,,,

Then if you still are taking it, I prefer to take it on an empty stomach if possible as there is less chance of the smell coming back due to burping. Then I wait about 30m before eating.

I usually just hold a bit of water in my mouth and swallow it as quick as possible, but I suppose you could try covering a capsule in something to mask the smell and taste.

Like I wouldn‚Äôt care for the deed if my life was on the line.  I stopped for a few days, morning woods returned and so did my libido.  I then restarted again and same result.  I did a fair bit of research, something of the things that came up was low grade acidosis and i tried supplementing with magnesium and eating more potassium rich foods but that only worked for couple of days.  The problem is especially worse if I eat carbs, even moderate amounts(<75 per day).  The only other supplement that crashed my libido like this was glycine but I stopped that weeks ago.  I looked into methylation issue, but  I don‚Äôt know how that can be a problem since I take enough b vitamins everyday including methylated b12 and methyl folate. I mentioned the glycine part in case someone here can see or has seen an overlap.   My current magnesium supplement isn‚Äôt magnesium glycinate.

You‚Äôve also probably shut down your DHT production. Your body naturally converts T to DHT in the body. It‚Äôs responsible for our masculine features, strength and virility. Problem is it‚Äôs an uphill battle to switch these receptors back on or get them firing full cylinders again. Stay away from herbal supplements. You will need to up your dietary cholesterol. Testosterone is made from cholesterol. Whole eggs (with the yolk) fatty cuts of meat. Make sure you are in a calorie surplus. Keep up moderate exercise and sleep. Make sure your sleep to recover. Stop taking supplements in excess like magnesium and potassium. These supplements come in lower dosages in multivitamins on purpose they are only 25% of your RDA compared to other minerals on the label. This is because we normally get enough and you can EASILY overdose. Have a balanced diet. Too much potassium causes single channel activity with hormones.

Taurine relaxes smooth muscles (think: the heart). A smooth muscle is an involuntary muscle. You can move your arm, make the tricep shorten or lengthen, but you can't move your heart.

Taurine is relaxing overall. Taken in the evening, it will help calm you and get you ready for sleep. A good dose for that is 1g - 3g. I believe people can take up to 10g/day with no problem, but don't go drinking 10g of taurine in 'energy' drinks.",Careless-Painter4608,1748017193.0,,,,

comment,mu2v6gf,1ktb6ea,2,,,0,"You are right that it is difficult to see the effects of taking taurine. It affects so many metabolic processes, and each effect is often too subtle to notice, so I'm not surprised that many people try it, see no effect, and give up on it. Few people are aware that taurine has mild but pervasive anti-inflammatory effects and that it improves immune function. The two areas where people usually agree its effects are obvious, not subtle are (1) as an adjuvant to coffee, and (2) as a sleep aid. 

I take five grams per day: 

  - 2 g with my morning espressos; 
  - 1 g at lunch;
  - 1 g around 5:30pm; 
  - 1 g just before bed. 

If I happen to wake up in the middle of the night, to help fall back asleep I take a pre-prepared cocktail of supps that includes 1 g of taurine. Since I wake up almost every night, I should have said I take 6 g per day.",Duduli,1748125072.0,,,,

comment,mtto4dp,1ktb6ea,-1,,,0,"so you decided to start taking taurine just when the new study on taurine showing it increases cancer risk came out? bad timing. i take a small amount as magnesium taurate (magnesium bound to taurine), i also take magnesium glycinate, those are my two magnesium sources. i don't take taurine on its own, but i get a little of it since it's combined with magnesium. i was considering giving it up after the new study though.

on the other hand, it seems from your post history that you are mainly interested in it as a way to reduce the withdrawal symptoms from quitting alcohol? in that case some elevated cancer risk might be acceptable because alcohol has a much higher chance of giving you cancer than taurine does. so anything that can help you reduce alcohol consumption should be tried out.",rinkuhero,1748003316.0,,,,

What iron supplements can be taken any time of the day regardless of when I have my meals and still give me my daily dose of iron?

It doesn‚Äôt matter if it only gives me a small amount each day. At this point, low absorption is better than doing nothing and watching my hemoglobin levels plummet further.

Mind, afaik, pretty much any iron supplement will work if you're not too bothered with lower absorption rates. Take it with vitamin C to improve absorption or find an iron supplement that already contains vitamin C. Also, it seems absorption is better if you take iron every other day instead of daily.

NOW Iron Complex caps is pretty cheap and includes low doses of vitamin C (for absorption) and methylated folate & B12 (for red blood cell production). If you can't handle methylated, the tablet version contains good old folic acid and cyanocobalamin.

‚Ä¢ How to repair gut health, adrenal burnout, and low testosterone (naturally)

‚Ä¢ How to reset your circadian rhythm and cortisol timing for better sleep and energy

Magnesium is depleted by stress, caffeine, alcohol, and soil degradation. It's essential for over 300 enzymatic reactions, including those related to sleep, detoxification, blood sugar regulation, and stress.

WHY LOCAL & ORGANIC MATTERS

Locally sourced foods have higher levels of vitamin C, folate, antioxidants, and fewer synthetic chemicals. Regenerative agriculture practices enhance soil mineral content.

METHYLATION GENETICS: MTHFR / COMT / MAOA

Individuals with methylation issues should avoid folic acid and synthetic B12. Recommended supplements include:

Thorne Basic B Complex

Pure Encapsulations MethylAssist (Works great, high quality, but owned by Nestl√© unfortunately)

Seeking Health B-Minus

ADDICTION RECOVERY REPAIR

Substance use depletes glutamine, magnesium, zinc, and B complex vitamins. Recovery protocols should focus on:

Glutamine (supports gut-brain axis)

Magnesium (aids in calmness and sleep)

B Complex (supports dopamine production and stress response)

Omega-3 (facilitates brain repair)

Adaptogens (enhances HPA axis resilience)

GUT HEALTH IS YOUR FOUNDATION

Gut health influences hormones, mood, detoxification, sleep, energy, and inflammation. Addressing gut imbalances is crucial for overall health.

ACUPUNCTURE IS LEGIT (HERE‚ÄôS WHY)

Acupuncture enhances vagus nerve tone, blood flow, pain regulation, cortisol levels, digestion, and hormonal balance through measurable mechanisms.

Side Note : Acupuncture has helped me more then anything in this world on a variety of levels, can even help with recovery and addiction.

STRUCTUAL ALIGNMENT AND MENTAL CLARITY

This is one of my favorite subjects and overlooked by the average population. Scucture and body alignment influence us far more than how we look at it. They directly affect brain function, mental clarity, and emotional regulation.

Chronic misalignment from the jaw to the hips can compress nerves, reduce oxygen to the brain, and disrupt the balance between stress and relaxation systems.

Forward head posture, mouth breathing, or poor pelvic tilt can impair vagus nerve tone, decrease cognitive performance, and increase that lingering anxiety.

Supporting structure through nasal breathing, postural correction, mobility work, and jaw alignment can lead to noticeable improvements in clarity, focus, and resilience  even more so when paired with nervous system support.

LYMPHATIC HEALTH AND DETOX

The lymphatic system plays a major role in clearing waste, regulating immunity, and reducing inflammation. We can use aimple tools like dry brushing, rebounding, proper hydration, and lymphatic massage can greatly help move stagnant fluid and support daily detoxification.

LIGHT HYGIENE AND SLEEP RHYTHMS

Light exposure patterns directly influence circadian rhythms, melatonin production, and hormonal balance. Morning sunlight helps anchor your internal clock, while avoiding blue light in the evening supports better sleep. Switching to red or amber lighting at night can reduce melatonin disruption. (This works very well for me, personally)

 https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side

---

NASAL BREATHING AND SLEEP OPTIMIZATION

Breathing through the nose enhances oxygen absorption, supports nitric oxide production. (Stop breathing through your mouth) breathing through your nose can also help regulate the nervous system. Mouth taping during sleep may reduce snoring, improve sleep quality, and encourage deeper rest, though it's not appropriate for everyone and should be used with great caution.

HORMONE DISRUPTERS IN EVERY DAY PRODUCTS

Endocrine disrupting chemicals like BPA, phthalates, and PFAS are often found in plastics, cookware, and personal care items. These compounds interfere with testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid signaling. Reducing exposure by choosing clean packaging and products can support hormonal balance.

 https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/index.cfm

---

Blood Sugar Stability and Metabolic Health

Stable blood sugar improves mood, energy, and hormonal health. Walking after meals, adding apple cider vinegar before carbs, and building meals around protein, fiber, and fat can reduce insulin spikes and support long-term metabolic flexibility.

MITOCHONDRIA AND FATIGUE

Mitochondrial health is incredibly crucial, but throughout my life, it seems to constantly be an overlooked piece of overall wellness. These tiny energy factories inside your cells convert nutrients into usable fuel or, in short, (ATP), they regulate inflammation, and literally influence everything from hormone production to mental clarity. When mitochondria become dysfunctional due to stress, poor sleep, nutrient deficiencies, or even environmental toxins, we end up getting fatigue, brain fog, or poor recovery. 

Supporting mitochondrial function often involves more than just supplements. While nutrients like CoQ10, acetyl-L-carnitine, magnesium, PQQ, and B vitamins help improve energy production and resilience, we can introduce new habits like morning sunlight exposure, breathwork, intermittent fasting, cold showers, and regular exercise. These all stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and function. If you're doing everything else right but still feel low energy or inflamed, mitochondrial optimization may be missing in your life.

Testosterone and Natural Optimization

Testosterone plays a huge role in energy, mood, strength, libido, and recovery. As most of us know, our levels often decline as we age, are stressed, have poor sleep, or have excess body fat. The nice thing is, several lifestyle strategies can help restore balance. Strength training, quality sleep, and weight management are proven to support healthy testosterone. A diet rich in protein, healthy fats, and nutrients like zinc and vitamin D are highly important. Chronic stress and high cortisol can suppress testosterone, making breathwork and recovery essential. There has been evidence that when using herbs like ashwagandha and tongkat ali for those under stress can help, but I have learned, foundational habits matter most.

ADAPTOGEN CYCLING: WHY, WHEN, AND HOW

Prolonged use of adaptogens can reduce efficacy or cause disruptions.

Cycle Guidelines:

Ashwagandha: 6-8 weeks on, 2-4 weeks off

Rhodiola: 3 weeks on, 1 week off or 5 days on, 2 days off

Maca: 3 weeks on, 1 week off

Holy Basil: 6 weeks on, 2 weeks off

Cautions:

Individuals with COMT slow variants may experience overstimulation from rhodiola or maca

Ashwagandha may lower thyroid function or blood pressure

Poor methylators might experience mood swings with certain adaptogens

Tip: Monitor heart rate variability (HRV) or mood to determine when to pause usage

Reduction of depression and anxiety by 4 weeks Hericium erinaceus intake

comment,mtr60u9,1kt5y3z,3,,,0,"As with anything, YMMV.


According to studies, there are some whose anxiety increases rather than decreases, sometimes depending on dose.


I'm one who is affected that way, too.


edit: previous thread

https://www.healthycell.com/blogs/articles/what-are-the-side-effects-of-l-theanine


While L-theanine is generally known for its calming and anti-anxiety effects, in some rare instances, it might actually increase feelings of anxiety in certain individuals.¬†


**Potential Reasons for Increased Anxiety:**

**Impact on Neurotransmitters:**


¬†L-theanine primarily works by influencing neurotransmitters like serotonin and GABA in the brain. It's thought that the way L-theanine alters the balance of these chemicals might, in rare cases, lead to increased anxiety.



**Decreased Serotonin Levels:**


¬†In addition to potentially increasing serotonin, L-theanine has also been shown to decrease serotonin levels in some cases, which could lead to increased stress and tension.



**Interaction with Caffeine:**


If you consume L-theanine through caffeinated drinks like green tea, the stimulant effects of caffeine can increase heart rate and intensify reactions to anxiety-producing stimuli, potentially counteracting the calming effects of L-theanine.



**MTHFR Gene Mutation:**


Some individuals with the MTHFR gene mutation might experience an opposite effect, where L-theanine increases anxiety rather than reduces it, as it increases GABA levels, which can have an adverse effect on those with this mutation.¬†",WorkOnThesisInstead,1747961021.0,,,,

submission,1kt5bhv,,0,Which of these supplements could be causing digestive problems?,0.5,,"I'm taking:NAC, Glycine, Taurine, Magnesium Glycinate, L-Theanine, Myo-Inositol, Hyaluronic Acid, Collagen Peptides, Omega-3, Vitamin D+K2, Vitamin C, B12.

I've always had occasional issues with bile flow - maybe once every 2-3 months I'd need digestive enzymes after eating something really fatty. But since I started taking these supplements, I'm having digestive problems every day.

The main symptoms are small burps that happen even hours after eating, and I get this feeling like food is sitting heavy in my upper stomach or occasionally coming back up slightly (sorry if that's TMI).

I stopped taking taurine 3 days ago since I read it can promote bile production, but I'm still having the same problems. I'm planning to stop glycine next for the same reason.

My questions:

* Does magnesium glycinate affect bile production the same way regular glycine does?
* Are there any other supplements on my list that might be contributing to this?
* Any suggestions for supplements that could actually help with digestion (should i try lecithin)?

The tricky part is that my anxiety has improved dramatically since starting these supplements, so I'm really hoping to find a solution.

I started taking the following 2 weeks ago:

* NAC 600mg - 3 pills (1800mg total)
* Glycine 1000mg - 2 pills (2000mg total)
* Taurine 500mg - 2 pills (1000mg total) *stopped 3 days ago*
* Magnesium Glycinate - 2 pills (400mg total)
* L-Theanine 200mg - 1 pill
* Myo-Inositol 12g - 4g x 3 times daily
* Hyaluronic Acid 50mg - 2 pill
* Collagen Peptides Powder - 8g
* Omega-3 (500mg EPA / 250mg DHA) - 1 pill
* Vitamin D + K2 (cholecalciferol and MK4) - 100mcg
* Vitamin C - 100mg
* MethylB12 - 250mcg

submission,1kt2df2,,4,How supporting your liver and system could make supplements work effectively,0.84,,"So I‚Äôve been reflecting on how my body reacts to supplements over time. About a decade ago, I could take things like magnesium glycinate without any issues. Honestly, most supplements worked fine back then. But in the past few years, I started noticing that some of them, including magnesium glycinate (using this an example for this post), were actually having a negative effect. I took breaks, reintroduced them, but the results just weren‚Äôt the same.

Then last year, I started taking milk thistle and felt this surprising boost in energy and an overall sense of well-being. I was surprised by the reaction but I guess I shouldn't be. The liver does a lot for us! Encouraged by that, I decided to give magnesium glycinate another shot, and this time, the difference was noticeable in a good way.

It got me thinking. Maybe the way our bodies respond to supplements isn‚Äôt just about the supplement itself or the ingredients in them. I notice a lot of people pin the small amount of glycinate for the overall reaction. A lot of what we take can place a load on the liver, and considering how much stress our environments already put on that system, it‚Äôs no wonder things change. It might not be as simple as saying a supplement doesn‚Äôt work for you. It could have more to do with how healthy and supported your body is overall, especially your liver and gut.

If your gut health is off or your system is overwhelmed, even the best supplements might not do much. But once you start improving your gut health, or supporting your body‚Äôs natural detox pathways, those same supplements might suddenly start working again.

So yeah, I just wanted to share that personal experience for anyone who‚Äôs written off certain supplements. Sometimes it‚Äôs not really about the supplement. It‚Äôs about the state of your system when you're taking it that can breathe a new life into things you've written off before.

submission,1kt0qv8,,2,Supplements to help reverse/repair/rehab what ketamine/spravato did to my brain,0.75,,"Hi,

I did 6 treatments of spravato/ketamine over a year ago. The treatments themselves were fine. After the treatments I would feel exhausted and not great. Never had a positive change in my mood. My provider knew this and encouraged me to stick with it. My anxiety was growing but reading online and talking with her would result in something like ""this is normal and means it is bringing up things/trauma that you will need to deal with"". It was never like that for me tho, I never had epiphanies or ""wow, that childhood trauma needs to be dealt with"" or visions of ways to overcome the depression. I would trip, feel nauseated, go home, feel out of it but not in any productive way. I felt myself getting dumber kind of out of it.

Unfortunately, it only got worse. I could no longer drive regularly because of cognitive issues. I can't think clearly enough and quick enough to feel safe behind the wheel. Short and long term memory issues, my brain is slow, processing things is slow, I can no longer work due to these issues, really, really bad anxiety and SI (which I didn't have prior to spravato). Word recall, spelling, thinking is difficult and paying attention to things as well. I have headaches frequently. The worst part is the anxiety and SI. I was approved for spravato for depression, but this anxiety I have now is worse than the depression. Overall I feel like I lost the best parts of myself. I feel like I have anhedonia now. In addition to my job that I had for many, many years I was an artist and artisan and I can no longer do those things. I feel like I have brain damage or what I think people with brain damage might go through. I've seen many drs, specialist and extensive blood work came back normal. I will be seeing a neurologist soon.

I know I'm in the minority and many people have had great outcomes with ketamine. My question is, do you have any input as to how someone can reverse, rehabilitate and/or repair from what ketamine did to my brain? I'm trying my best to research but it is confusing and there isn't a lot of info out there. My drs. have just said give it time but I feel like I have. My thought is, if I can figure out what it does to brains, then maybe I can treat it with meds and/or supplements. For ex. if it released a lot of glutamate and my brain short circuited in that way, then maybe I can try to reduce glutamate somehow.

Thank you in advance. My apologies for typos and if anything doens't make sense. I tried to proofread but that doesn't always work.",Eastern_Guava_4269,1747944972.0,4,Recommendations ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kt0qv8/supplements_to_help_reverserepairrehab_what/

I started taking Inositol & DMAE in the mornings and felt really good on that combo, and wanted to learn as much as I could about DMAE. 

When researching it I learned about Alpha-GPC and thought that might be good to take instead of or along side it, but when I take it I‚Äôm instantly exhausted, like within 10 minutes. 

The last few nights I‚Äôve taken it before bed I‚Äôve had DEEP sleep and am not groggy in the morning. It‚Äôs great! 

My question is: is the fatigue something I should be concerned about or is it just the way my body processes it? I take the Nootropics Depot 150mg

I know I should ‚Äúask my Dr‚Äù but in my experience most doctors don‚Äôt have the knowledge about supplements anyway, and/or roll their eyes at them whereas I‚Äôve had really good results with them, so figured I would ask this sub.

He hit a deer on the highway in Utah and asked the police for help (this was after driving non-stop without sleep for 25 hours). The police recommended going to the ER for drug testing. He went along (partly because he was sleep deprived). The ER said he was clear for drugs but refused to let him go and sent him to a psych ward instead. At the psych ward he refused to take medication and so they forcefully injected him with drugs. He was released after a month of medication (zyprexa, haloperidol, invega sustenna). He had awful side effects for months after including sedation, drooling, headaches, blurry vision, extreme constipation, muscle tics, etc.

These went away but he also gained 25 lbs, his hormone levels are still messed up, and he is still cognitively slow from the medication (3 minor car accidents) and worried about long term brain damage‚Ä¶

When he looked at his medical records, most of it is fabricated just so doctors could bill his insurance. The doctors said he was hallucinating and worried about hackers and the CIA / FBI but he never said any of that. In the psych ward another patient tried to fight him but a different patient intervened. But in his medical records they said he was the one bothering patients üòÇ

His doctor (a DO, not even a full MD) has multiple 1 star ratings calling him a ""monster"". Chat GPT found that the hospital changed their name recently because hospital staff were caught sexually assaulting a 12-year old girl. Randomly it also turns out that Paris Hilton was abused in a similar facility as a teenager in the exact same town.

From mid-April to now (mid-May), I've decided to increase my NAC dosage to 1200mg 1x/day.

Here's what I noticed:

I have a few long strands of white hair that's now half black (my natural color).

I still have white hairs on the top of my head, but they seem to be less... intense? Meaning the density is lower and the white also doesn't seem as ""bright."" It's almost as if the white hairs itself is thinner in terms of the hair strand, whereas before the white hairs were the same thickness as my black hair.

I'm curious to hear if anyone else noticed NAC helping in reducing gray/white hair? Any other anecdotes or experiences?",tofu_baby_cake,1747920778.0,18,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1ksqt4g/i_swear_nac_is_slowing_my_white_hair_growth/

comment,mtmpfar,1ksmvlf,0,,,0,"The body responds to iron supplementation by releasing hepcidin which blocks further iron absorption significantly for another 24-36hours. The corresponding unabsorbed iron from further supplementation in this window causes all sorts of not fun side effects.  Which is why many studies were done to see how effective every second day iron supplementation is compared to daily, and found it on par, but not only with significantly less side effects, but also significantly less people dropped out of the studies. 

Taking iron 3x a day is just ridiculous.  Taking iron daily less so but with serious gastrointestinal side effects still present.  Look into every second day dosing.  Also why are you taking such huge amounts of iron? Even in the worst cases of anemia and severe ferritin deficiency such huge daily intakes via supplementation can cause issues.  Id recommend revisiting dosage and timing.  Or look into transfusions

submission,1ksl0sm,,0,Is it possible to get an upset stomach from carbonyl iron (vitron-c)? I need help please.,0.33,,"Hi! I've been trying to Google this and search on my own but I'm not coming up with much. 

Last year, after some blood work, my doctor prescribed me some iron tablets. They were the ferrous sulphate kind and upset my intestines pretty badly. Usually my digestion is pretty healthy and regular but these were wrecking my intestines so I gave up on them after about a week.

I did some quick googling and reddit reading and found that carbonyl iron (vitron c) is supposed to be much gentler or have no side effects at all. So I thought brilliant! That's what I'll get! (I don't live in the US btw).

So I've been taking carbonyl iron almost daily for about 6 months. My intestines were fine but I noticed I started to get severe burping and the amount of gas I'm having in my stomach makes me nauseous and just lack an appetite. I have never had a problem with burping in my life. I didn't think the iron could be the cause because everything I read about carbonyl iron said that it doesn't have any negative effects on digestion so I never put two and two together and just kept taking them.

However, I'm starting to think that these pills have been impacting my stomach and causing gastritis or something like it. Is this possible? I stopped taking them about three weeks ago and the burping has lessened a little bit but I'm still having a lot of stomach discomfort most days.

I've read that iron tablets can very much cause gastritis but I think the iron in those studies was ferrous sulphate, not carbonyl iron. 

So is it possible for carbonyl iron to negatively affect your stomach/digestion? And what should I take to help heal it?

(I have been to a gastroenterologist who said it's just acid reflux and to take famotidine or Omeprazole and that I may need to be on it indefinitely which I wasn't thrilled with. She didn't seem concerned about the iron. She had me tested for h. pylori which came out negative but I know the gold standard is a biopsy. I'm just not yet ready to undergo an endoscopy  because I react to badly anesthetic.)

Through more research from my DNA results, I would do well with CDP choline aswell.   
  
So somehow I'd like to throw this in here as well? This is from chat GPT -

submission,1kshfis,,51,Ashwaghanda: This may help prevent long-term side effects,0.81,,"

I tried a 600mg Ashwagandha Root Powder capsule the other day and was blown away with the mood enhancing, calming effects while still keeping motivation and productivity high, and refreshing sleep it gave me. So naturally I wanted to learn more about it before taking more, remembering I heard some people had bad effects from it. And indeed, from this sub and everywhere else on the internet, it sounds like some people have experienced the opposite symptoms in the long term, plus anhedonia, and withdrawal symptoms when trying to stop. But strangely, many people also said they experienced none of those, even after daily intake and no breaks for months. So I thought to myself, I would be curious to see what kind of nutrition these two types of people have? Could the group who experienced bad effects have sub par nutrition, and the other group a better or more complete nutrition with no deficiency? Here‚Äôs what I asked Chatgpt (yes, disclosing how I got these answers, not trying to pretend these are the results of research etc):

‚ÄúWhat nutrient does ashwagandha make use of in your body to give you its nice effects of better sleep, relaxation, positive mood? Just looking to support what it possibly depletes over time‚Äù

Here is what Chatgpt came up with:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Ashwagandha is an adaptogen that influences several systems in the body, and while it generally supports rather than depletes nutrients, long-term or high-dose use may affect or rely on the following key nutrients and systems:

1. GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)
	‚Ä¢	Function: GABA is the main calming neurotransmitter. Ashwagandha enhances GABAergic activity, promoting relaxation and better sleep.
	‚Ä¢	Support: Your body needs vitamin B6, magnesium, and zinc to synthesize GABA. Prolonged stimulation of GABA pathways might mildly deplete these nutrients over time.

2. Thyroid Hormones
	‚Ä¢	Ashwagandha can boost thyroid function, particularly T3 and T4 levels.
	‚Ä¢	Support: Requires iodine, selenium, zinc, and iron to produce thyroid hormones. If you‚Äôre borderline deficient, ongoing ashwagandha use might accelerate depletion.

3. Cortisol Regulation & Adrenal Support
	‚Ä¢	Ashwagandha reduces cortisol and supports adrenal balance.
	‚Ä¢	Support: Healthy adrenal function depends on vitamin C, B5 (pantothenic acid), magnesium, and B6.

4. Dopamine & Serotonin (Mood Enhancement)
	‚Ä¢	Ashwagandha has mild effects on dopamine and serotonin levels.
	‚Ä¢	Support: Requires B vitamins (especially B6, B12, folate), magnesium, and amino acids (like tryptophan and tyrosine).

‚∏ª

Summary: Nutrients to Watch or Support When Taking Ashwagandha Long-Term
	‚Ä¢	Magnesium
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin B6
	‚Ä¢	Zinc
	‚Ä¢	Selenium
	‚Ä¢	Iodine
	‚Ä¢	Iron
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin C
	‚Ä¢	B5, B12, Folate
	‚Ä¢	Protein/amino acids

If you‚Äôre taking ashwagandha daily or at high doses, consider supporting your system with a good B-complex, magnesium, and a trace mineral supplement or a high-quality multivitamin. Let me know if you‚Äôd like a food-based support plan or specific supplement recommendations.



Why Some People Crash After Ashwagandha, While Others Don‚Äôt

1. Nutritional Status
	‚Ä¢	Ashwagandha works through your body‚Äôs systems ‚Äî calming neurotransmitters, hormones, and stress pathways. If you‚Äôre nutrient-deficient, it can create a crutch effect.
	‚Ä¢	Those with solid stores of B vitamins, magnesium, zinc, selenium, iodine, and amino acids can better maintain balance if they stop.
	‚Ä¢	Solution: Support your body with nutrient-dense foods and/or targeted supplements while taking ashwagandha. Don‚Äôt rely on it to ‚Äúdo the job‚Äù alone.

2. Individual Neurotransmitter Balance
	‚Ä¢	People with low natural GABA or dopamine may feel like they ‚Äúneed‚Äù ashwagandha once it starts working. Removing it can lead to a crash unless the root imbalance is fixed.
	‚Ä¢	Solution: Support natural GABA and dopamine production through things like:
	‚Ä¢	Magnesium glycinate
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin B6 (P5P)
	‚Ä¢	L-theanine or taurine (for GABA)
	‚Ä¢	Tyrosine and B-complex (for dopamine)

3. Dosage & Duration
	‚Ä¢	High doses over long periods (without breaks) can cause downregulation or dependency.
	‚Ä¢	Solution: Stick to moderate doses (300‚Äì600 mg/day) and consider cycling ‚Äî 5 days on / 2 days off, or one week off every 6‚Äì8 weeks.

4. Underlying Hormonal or Adrenal Imbalances
	‚Ä¢	Ashwagandha modulates thyroid and cortisol. If your body is already dysregulated, it can overcorrect or become dependent on ashwagandha to function.
	‚Ä¢	Solution: Monitor your thyroid, adrenal, and sex hormones if you feel like it‚Äôs doing too much heavy lifting. Bloodwork or symptom tracking can help.

5. Bioindividuality / Genetics
	‚Ä¢	Some people metabolize adaptogens differently due to genetic variants (e.g., COMT, MAO-A, CYP450 enzymes).
	‚Ä¢	Solution: There‚Äôs no perfect fix here, but self-awareness helps. If you‚Äôre highly sensitive to mood-altering substances or adaptogens, be cautious and adjust slowly.


 How to Make Sure Ashwagandha Keeps Working ‚Äî and Never Hurts You
	1.	Take Nutrient Support Daily
	‚Ä¢	Focus on: Magnesium, B6, B12, folate, zinc, selenium, iodine, vitamin C, high-quality protein.
	‚Ä¢	Optional: Add GABA or dopamine precursors if you‚Äôre vulnerable to low mood or anhedonia.
	2.	Cycle It
	‚Ä¢	Try 5 days on, 2 days off.
	‚Ä¢	Or 6‚Äì8 weeks on, 1‚Äì2 weeks off.
	‚Ä¢	Or simply take breaks when stress is lower.
	3.	Monitor How You Feel
	‚Ä¢	If you start feeling flat, overly sedated, unmotivated, or disconnected, it might be too much.
	‚Ä¢	Reduce dose or pause if needed.
	4.	Avoid Overreliance
	‚Ä¢	If you‚Äôre only sleeping well or feeling okay because of ashwagandha, that‚Äôs a sign to strengthen the foundation (lifestyle, nutrients, mindset, movement).
	5.	Support Liver Detox
	‚Ä¢	Since herbs are processed through the liver, supporting detox with milk thistle, dandelion, or just hydration + cruciferous veggies helps prevent sluggishness or side effects.

‚∏ª

Summary Plan:

To keep Ashwagandha safe, helpful, and long-term sustainable:
	‚Ä¢	Take magnesium, B-complex, trace minerals, and protein
	‚Ä¢	Cycle it, don‚Äôt go nonstop
	‚Ä¢	Watch for over-sedation or loss of joy/motivation (signs of too much GABA or downregulation)
	‚Ä¢	Take breaks regularly and reset your baseline
	‚Ä¢	Live a nutrient-dense, balanced lifestyle so your body isn‚Äôt relying on any one crutch

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Not saying Chatgpt‚Äôs got it right but this may be a start. Nutritionally-wise, my bases are covered, I eat a high nutrient varied diet and take tons of vitamins daily. But I will still try to take Ashwagandha never 2 days in a row and only as on a needed basis. If this is too cautious and you are a long term user please chime in with your experience, thank you so much!

A while ago I would take fish oil and it would give me great effects mentally, and then I started developing skin reaction from it and eventually started to get a lot of inflammation and had to stop taking it. 

Eventually, I found flax seed oil along with soaked chia seeds really helped. But neither of these things are as easy to travel with because soaked chia takes some time to soak and I often don't have time for that when moving around. And flax seed oil needs to stay chilled in the fridge after opening. I haven't tried the supplement form though and it may be just fine.

My condition is severe and even something that makes it just a bit better, is worth it. Reading about the risk of it building up in arteries is slightly worrying however. Should I make sure I take K2 alongside it? I‚Äôm just a bit worried about that because I recently had a PE and K2 is known to be involved in clotting. I‚Äôm not on warfarin thankfully, I know that would be a no go. I was on apixiban and am off it now but may have to go back on, blood test dependant. So not sure about the risks of K2 in my situation and whether they outweigh the risks of calcium building up.

Here we go.. I've been taking Magnesium this last year.  I started with Oxide.   Learned that Oxide is the least helpful and transferred to Glycinate.  Watching utube and reading doc.  I came across 6 (sometimes 7) different kinds of Magnesiums.  I have learned that I NEED L-Threonate.  Recently my doctor took a look at my list and said that she also takes glycinate and threonate.  That she does recommend I take both glycinate in morning and L-threonate before sleep.   Now my simple question - I wasn't aware that both are shaped and colored the same and I when I prepared my weekly dispenser I mixed up the magnesium.  Actually, I know that one week of mixing it up is not going to do anything to me. Right?  The more important question is do I follow the instruction on the bottle. Sports Research  advises 3 capsules which will give me 144mg of L-threonate.  Qunol advises that I take 2 capsules = 420mg of glycinate.  (i take 4 tabs of 25mg Zoloft a day).**  ",Proper-Attitude7428,1747867643.0,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1ksbhuo/magnesium/

You may be able to look more closely at the capsules and see if there are any differences - some have round dents where the capsule halfs are joined. Some dents are square. Sometimes they are at a different location. You have to look closely.

Stop all supplements for at least 2-3 weeks to allow your body to reset and get a baseline. Too many people take supplements for too long and many end up being counter productive. After that, pay attention to how you feel without them and then slowly introduce them back in one by one. The point is to identify what makes you feel better and what doesn't. B vitamins are very important but if you have methylation issues, some may be problematic such as folate and methyl B12. I'm personally a fan of ashwagandha but it's important to take breaks with it.

comment,mtm4x5m,1ks2z16,1,,,0,"I have only recently reconfigured my supplements. 

High dose B2 is the main discovery. I had been using 20mg a day for years, then decided to try higher doses after reading some studies, and Chris Masterjohn. Went to 50mg 4x a day. Migraine doses are 100mg 4x a day for some with insignificant side effects, so I read.

A week in, and I haven't used zinc at all for anxiety since day 1. In fact, I had been taking 5mg copper (bisglycinate) a day for the first 5 days. I'll restart zinc shortly for other reasons than anxiety, so it appears. This has been a very huge surprise for me.

Had a few episodes of euphoria on taking it, though I haven't figured that out yet. It happened when taking it with other things, especially certain foods, and I'm trying to zero in on the synergic combo. 

This would be supporting the mthfr enzyme. Apparently, in some weakened situations, the crucial cofactor FAD needs to mob the mthfr when it's not stable in performing without the crowd. Very human.

The transsulfuration cycle side of things seemed to need help in keeping up. So I'm taking a bit of nac, taurine, and phosphatidylcholine. 

As usual, I also use 5-20 mg p5p ( depending on how much sleep I want, 1mg 5mthf, and 5 mg methylcobalamin per day.

What I'm after is to solve the constant fatigue many of us have. So far, it looks promising. 

Another enormous surprise is gaining facial expressions. The B2 has been able to put a better disposition on my face that doesn't frighten people. Often, after night shifts, I avoid appearing in public. Anything I say gets taken the wrong way unless like a few years ago when we had to wear masks. Then I was wondering why people were being friendly to me. The mega doses of B2 are getting me that without the face covering. In case someone can understand the effects of caffeine, that would usually have the same effect on my face as being tired, even if I was well rested. Now, with high doses of riboflavin, my face can survive coffee and chocolate! 

So, while I've found a new solution for anxiety, there have been other bonuses paid out.",anniedaledog,1747896655.0,,,,

comment,mtmo5sp,1ks2z16,1,,,0,"It depends entirely on the underlying cause of your anxiety.

If your anxiety is driven by oxidative stress, then certain antioxidants may provide relief by neutralizing excess reactive oxygen species and supporting mitochondrial function.
However, if oxidative stress is not the root cause, introducing antioxidants can paradoxically worsen your anxiety, especially if they interfere with adaptive signaling or reduce metabolic drive.

Likewise, if your anxiety stems from a vagal dominance, low metabolic rate, or functional hypometabolism, then calming agents like GABA, magnesium, glycine, or taurine ‚Äì which further lower neural activity and reduce sympathetic tone ‚Äì can actually make things worse. They may deepen the metabolic inhibition and amplify the sense of fatigue, derealization, or even panic-like states.

Magnesium glycinate, this one really is a game changer. Super cheap and you can get it on Amazon. It takes at least a week especially if your magnesium deficient to notice and effect. But over time I noticed that my stress and overall anxiety levels were a lot lower.


CBD is another could recommendation. I use this overall everyday and notice the most benefits from it. I'll take these in a gummy form just to stay consistent with the dosage. For night time I will use CBN and CBD together and have noticed overall my baseline anxiety has been a lot lower since using it. I used to be pretty anxious in the morning to begin with but after using both of these compounds I feel more rested and less anxious. I use these deep sleep gummies by herbal garden essentials, highly recommend them.


The next one I recommend is reishi mushroom. This one is just really good for keeping you centered and overall improving anxiety over the long term. It has made a difference in about a week for me.",Embarrassed_Cod_3824,1747958273.0,,,,
comment,mtrw2ph,1ks2z16,1,,,0,"For me the anxiety and depression are different things. Sometimes they happen together but I‚Äôd say 70% of the time I‚Äôm anxious maybe 15% of the time depressed.  

5-HTP has helped when I have spiraling thoughts or can‚Äôt stop ruminating on something.  But it can make me feel flat. Which is better than really anxious - but that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt take it all the time and definitely not while I‚Äôm depressed. 

I like mag - correction. I like mag glycinate.  I like K2.  I don‚Äôt know anything about ashwaganda.  Oddly I find CoQ10 helps with anxiety.  Was taking it because it‚Äôs supposed to be good for your heart but noticed a distinct pattern.  

Working out. Playing sports. I‚Äôm 50 but I play soccer in a rec league.  Worlds of difference in how I feel before vs after. 

Protein over carbs.  There‚Äôs a book about it called Protein not Prozac or something like that.  

Potassium to combat too much sodium.  Sodium salt raises blood pressure, which kind of puts your body into a hyped state, for me that triggers anxiety especially when I try to sleep. 

Fish oil - omega 3. 

If you have trouble sleeping look into the fisher-Wallace device.  It‚Äôs a head band that applies slight electrical currents to your head.  With your eyes closed you sometimes experience a flashing light.  Have one I don‚Äôt use any more but it helped me through a really dark period.

B1 and 12 deficiencies are connected to a host of health problems.

My teenage daughter recently had a nasojejunal (NJ) tube placed, which bypasses the stomach and delivers nutrition directly into the small intestine. This opens up a unique opportunity to try prebiotics and probiotics without the usual concern about stomach acid killing off beneficial bacteria.

She has a functional gastrointestinal disorder (also considered a gut-brain disorder), experiences significant anxiety, and is on the autism spectrum. At this point, she is exclusively formula fed through her NJ tube.

We‚Äôre only considering science- and research-backed supplements, and of course, anything we try will be reviewed and approved by her medical team beforehand.

That said, I‚Äôd love to hear from others who may have experience or knowledge in this area. Are there specific prebiotic or probiotic formulations that might be especially beneficial given her profile and delivery method? Any studies, brands, or strains you‚Äôd recommend looking into?

Thanks in advance for your guidance.",Alive_Education_8324,1747846358.0,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1ks2t8b/looking_for_preprobiotic_suggestions_for_a_teen/

I stopped taking it for about 10 days and my shoulder started bothering me again. I then started back with 3mg per day. Within a week, my shoulder had went back to almost no pain.

Not sure who ""it"" is... Recommendations for vitamin D are best based off blood testing, and official health guidelines are likely 600-800iu for you (not saying this is ideal for you personally). 4000iu is considered the upper daily limit (in the absence of a blood test saying otherwise). I'm of the belief that it's best to err on the side of using less rather than more when supplementing with essential nutrients, especially when there's not much information to go on (blood test, other health details, your UV exposure, etc.) Be aware that when supplementing with vitamin D, it stays in your system for weeks, so noticing changes from one day to the next is less common.  
  
Vitamin D supplementation is not commonly associated with causing anxiety in clinical settings, so either you've got something quite unique going on or it's something else causing the anxiety. Reducing or stopping the supplementation or switching brands/products would be common recommendations. If it's an option, consider prioritizing getting sun exposure as your main source and supplement as needed.

It sounds crazy, but it's true, and you're not making it up.  
  
The truth is that \*\*some people are quite sensitive to D3, especially when it affects calcium levels, magnesium balance, or neurotransmitters. What about switching brands? Sure, that can completely affect how your body works. The new one might absorb differently or have more components. It can take two weeks for things to pile up and cause things like panic, even if they didn't happen before.  
  
The regret hurts a lot because it's ""just a supplement,"" right? Something that is supposed to help. But the body is strange, and it doesn't necessarily read the label the same way we do. You did the correct thing by backing off to see how things went. Listen to your body. It's not about how many IUs are ""safe for most people."" It's about what \*your\* system can take.

A good rule of thumb is 100mcg K2mk7 and 100mg *elemental* mag per 1000iu D3. 
You can also calculate your requirement based on weight and current D status on sites like Grassroots Health. 
In the absence of a baseline reading of D I'd start back at 2000iu and make sure you're taking adequate cofactors, particularly magnesium (eg glycinate, citrate, malate - get decent brands that state elemental amount and don't use mag oxide fillers).

comment,mtoe6lo,1ks0wyf,1,,,2,"I've yet to see a quality human clinical trial demonstrate this. Additionally, to spike calcium levels that much you would expect a much higher dosage of vitamin D, likely in excess of 10,000iu daily for weeks or more.   
  
I think the reason this hasn't been documented more is because it's quite unlikely to occur. First, it's not D3 that increases calcium absorption, but the fully active hormone form, calcitriol. It's production is tightly regulated by numerous mechanisms, meaning metabolic disfunction, kidney/parathyroid disease or gross over-supplementation would be required to cause highly elevated calcitriol levels.   
  
This just addresses the vitamin D aspect. Such a person would likely also need to have a high calcium diet or more likely also be supplementing with high levels of calcium to accomplish your theory. Lastly, if all that were true, I would not expect such a person to notice a difference within 24hrs of stopping supplementation.

When I say it happens all the time, it doesn't happen to 100% of the people. Probably 5-10%. But I guarantee right now 1000 people are taking vitamin D somewhere out there and having heightened anxiety. 

Vitamin D activates calcium channels. Calcium channels are linked with anxiety and depression. Some blood pressure drugs that block calcium have also been shown to act as an antidepressant. Your doctor doesn't have time to read the below information. And even if they did, it's not their specialty. They would simply refer someone to a psychiatrist. And guess what. The psychiatrist wouldn't know this either. This is research, this is not clinical medicine. There is a difference. There is no way a doctor can keep up with all the research out there, they read a miniscule fraction of it yearly.

comment,mtv31rb,1ks0wyf,1,,,4,"OP's question was ""is this normal?"" No it isn't and chasing down remote possibilities distracts from more likely issues. If there are 1000 people dealing with this as you say, out of 8 billion people on the planet, OP has a greater chance of getting hit by lightning. If 10% of people taking 3000iu of D3 experienced extreme anxiety within two weeks as you suggest, I'd hazard a guess we'd know more about it.   
  
Nobody thinks doctors know everything, including doctors. However, medical science does follow a scientific approach, including thoughtfully weighing out the possibilities and moving forward on the best information available. As opposed to blackboard science, where when some one asks for evidence that 3000iu D3 is causing extreme anxiety in humans and you respond by pointing to clinical studies on rats/mice that don't involve vitamin D supplementation.

There could be merit to what you're saying in a different context but that doesn't make it a helpful comment to OP here. OP even states they previously took vitamin D without this issue, suggesting that the particular brand/product is a much more likely culprit than what you seem hellbent on. 

Good luck OP, I hope it's as simple as discontinuing the product and possibly replacing it with a trusted brand. In any instance, try to get your D levels tested and go from there.",Substantial-Type5566,1748018667.0,,,,

submission,1kry21q,,0,Excipients and coping with problems,0.5,,"I ingest over a dozen supplements, several times a week. I've been having uncomfortable skin allergies and rather than go fully on an elimination regimen cutting them out one by one I wondered whether anyone has tried filtering the capsules or even pills to reduce the quantity of excipients they're also ingesting. Where do the excipients come from is just one question and I don't think the blanket reviews by Consumer research companies study this (I had a subscription years ago to CR). On another reddit I saw a link to Mast Cell Activation article [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31126513/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31126513/) because I realize that just swallowing a handful of supplements I'm also getting a dose of rice flour and magnesium stearate etc. I think but don't know they're added to keeping main ingredients in the capsules fresh but when you add them all together what happens when you get large doses of cellulose, silica, stearic acid, silicon dioxide et al. And why not filter them out as you need them rather than asking our bodies to remove them. I tried this with some DHEA caps which apparently needs buccal absorption and got a mouthful of rice flour as well. Asking here, has anyone has tried filter paper or fine sieve for any supplement and what were the results. Some need to get through the stomach acid intact so this would make a supplement unfunctional. It seems like an unnecessary step but if you've eliminated all the food suspected of causing the allergy, then this may be the logical next step other than taking yourself off each and every vitamin for a couple weeks.",ShelleyFromEarth,1747834693.0,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kry21q/excipients_and_coping_with_problems/

submission,1krvspe,,1,"[25M] Life Extension Two-Per-Day - Incredible Initial Benefits (Zero Refractory Period, Stronger Erections on HALF dose) Followed by Severe Headaches. What Gives?",0.6,,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my recent experience with the Life Extension Two-Per-Day multivitamin and hopefully get some insights from you all.

Initially, the results were pretty amazing. I was taking **one capsule per day**, even though the serving size is two. So, I was effectively getting **half** of the nutrients listed below. During this initial phase on the half dose, I experienced a noticeable improvement in my sexual health: basically a zero refractory period between sex and significantly stronger erections. This was a huge positive for me.

However, after a few days of this, I started experiencing some of the worst headaches I've ever had in my life. It's a bit of a mystery to me what caused such a drastic shift.

I'm trying to understand what in this multivitamin, *even at the half dose I was taking*, could have contributed to those positive initial effects ‚Äì specifically the zero refractory period and stronger erections. And conversely, what might have triggered the severe headaches later on?

Here's the list of ingredients **per the recommended two-capsule serving** (I was taking one capsule, so half of these amounts):

* **Vitamin A** (as natural beta-carotene, Lycopene): 5000 IU
* **Vitamin C** (as ascorbic acid): 120 mg
* **Vitamin D3** (as cholecalciferol): 2000 IU
* **Vitamin E** (as d-alpha tocopherol): 50 IU
* **Vitamin K2** (as menaquinone-7): 80 mcg
* **Thiamin** (Vitamin B1): 30 mg
* **Riboflavin** (Vitamin B2): 25 mg
* **Niacin** (as niacinamide): 30 mg
* **Vitamin B6** (as pyridoxine HCl): 25 mg
* **Folate** (as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate calcium salt): 400 mcg
* **Vitamin B12** (as methylcobalamin): 300 mcg
* **Biotin**: 300 mcg
* **Pantothenic Acid** (as d-calcium pantothenate): 50 mg
* **Calcium** (as calcium citrate malate): 150 mg
* **Iodine** (from potassium iodide): 150 mcg
* **Magnesium** (as magnesium oxide): 100 mg
* **Zinc** (as L-OptiZinc): 25 mg
* **Selenium** (as SelenoExcell selenium yeast): 200 mcg
* **Copper** (as copper gluconate): 2 mg
* **Manganese** (as manganese citrate): 2 mg
* **Chromium** (as chromium picolinate): 200 mcg
* **Molybdenum** (as molybdenum amino acid chelate): 75 mcg
* **Potassium** (as potassium chloride): 50 mg
* **Choline** (as choline bitartrate): 25 mg
* **Inositol**: 25 mg
* **Boron** (as boron citrate): 1 mg
* **Vanadium** (as vanadyl sulfate): 50 mcg
* **Lutein** (from marigold flower extract): 500 mcg
* **Lycopene** (from Lycored tomato extract): 600 mcg

**Additional Components (per two-capsule serving):**

* **Alpha-lipoic acid**: 25 mg
* **Citrus bioflavonoid complex**: 25 mg
* **Green tea leaf extract** (standardized to polyphenols): 25 mg
* **Curcumin extract** (turmeric rhizome): 25 mg
* **Pomegranate fruit extract**: 25 mg
* **Grape seed extract**: 25 mg
* **Resveratrol** (from Polygonum cuspidatum root): 10 mg
* **Ginger root extract**: 10 mg
* **Coenzyme Q10** (ubiquinone): 10 mg

Has anyone experienced something similar, or does anyone have any theories on which of these ingredients (or combination thereof) *at the half-doses I was effectively taking* might have caused the initial positive effects, and which could be responsible for the headaches?

Appreciate any insights!",dragonwarrior_1,1747828056.0,5,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1krvspe/25m_life_extension_twoperday_incredible_initial/

I'm heading on a trip soon and I've been seeing a lot of ads for portable/travel pill containers. They seem like they could be pretty convenient, but I'm not sure if they're just a gimmick or genuinely useful.

I'd love to get your thoughts:

1. Have you ever bought or used a portable pill container specifically for travel? What was your experience like?
2. Based on your experience, do you think it's generally worth getting one for a trip?
3. If I do decide to buy one, what are the most important features or things I should consider to make sure I get a good/practical one? (e.g., size/capacity for number of days, material, durability, type of closure, number of compartments, ease of filling, discreteness, waterproofness, etc.)

Any recommendations for specific types or brands are also welcome if you have them, but mostly looking for general advice on whether they're useful and what features matter most.

It's just a basic rule of thumb - all in balance. 

Water is great, but too much can kill you. Things like ashwagandha etc might calm you down, but over a period of time might cause anhedonia.

A lot of anti ageing supplements tend to be anti oxidants that help to minimise damage to your body, by blunting free radical activity or aggressive immune system that might lead to inflammation. 

However if you're sick or have cancer, an aggressive immune system and free radicals destroying cells are what you need to combat it. And now these anti ageing stuff aren't helpful to you, but might make things worse.",jonoave,1747912864.0,,,,

This is why the latest cure for cancer is always just around the corner. Because there's always a new one in testing that shows promise in rodent models, in vitro, on paper, etc. and they need funding to support their research so they can get paid to pursue these cures.

Then it leads nowhere and you never hear about it again.

The same reason you can find ""evidence"" to support all the supplements out there, but most are rodent models or short-term lab studies funded by the manufacturers making wild claims and you'll be hard pressed to find long term cohort studies done by independent third parties to verify that it does anything.

I‚Äôm 42 years old, not overweight, and generally in good health. I don‚Äôt exercise much due to a heavy workload, but I do try to walk every day to stay active.

After reading through several posts on this sub, I‚Äôve put together the following list of supplements that seem commonly recommended for general health and longevity. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice or feedback:

	‚Ä¢	Vitamin D3
	‚Ä¢	B-Complex
	‚Ä¢	Omega-3 (Fish Oil)
	‚Ä¢	Magnesium
	‚Ä¢	Multimineral (Calcium + Zinc + Magnesium)
	‚Ä¢	CoQ10
	‚Ä¢	Curcumin
	‚Ä¢	NAC (N-acetylcysteine)
	‚Ä¢	Probiotics
	‚Ä¢	Collagen
	‚Ä¢	Fiber

       

Do you think it‚Äôs okay to go ahead with this list as a daily routine? Any known side effects or conflicts between these? Also, would you recommend taking them daily or switching to a weekly/dosed rotation?

I‚Äôm in my early 30s and recently started experiencing some mild stiffness in my right knee ‚Äî especially after walking or sitting for a long time. Nothing too painful, but it‚Äôs noticeable and I want to be proactive about joint health before it worsens.

I‚Äôve read a lot about collagen supplements being beneficial for joints, but there are so many types (Type I, II, III, hydrolyzed, UC-II, etc.), and I‚Äôm a bit overwhelmed.

I‚Äôm specifically looking for a collagen supplement that helps with joint lubrication, mobility, and long-term cartilage support.

	‚Ä¢	Has anyone here had good results with a specific type or brand of collagen for joints?

	‚Ä¢	Is Type II really the best for joint health, or is a multi-type blend better?

	‚Ä¢	Any difference between hydrolyzed collagen and undenatured collagen when it comes to knees?

I‚Äôd love to hear what‚Äôs worked for you. Thanks in advance!

almost all actions have risks and almost all supplements have side effects occasionally. i've experienced them rarely too. i've taken 50-100 different types of supplements over my lifetime, and only 1 or 2 of them had side effects so bad i had to quit that supplement. i don't still take that many supplements, i just mean that's the total number of different kinds i've tried, not all at the same time obviously.

DMAE gave me panic attacks, like i used to get panic attacks in my 20s and early 30s due to social anxiety, but hadn't gotten one in decades, and at age 46 i had my first panic attack in like 15 years. i wondered what caused it, and then i realized i had taken DMAE for the first time that day. so i quit that supplement. that's probably the worst example of a side effect i experienced. the vast majority of supplements i've used (including all the ones you mention) have had zero side effects in me. but that doesn't mean there isn't a tiny chance. just that the tiny chance is lower than getting into a car accident from driving to work or school etc.",rinkuhero,1747832814.0,,,,

Their products are of good quality, and they do third-party testing, which is important if you're going to be using anything for a long time. But to be honest, there are a few other good ones out there, like NOW, Jarrow, and Thorne. It really depends on what form you want and how much you want to spend.  
  
When it's handy, I've bought some of them from Amazon, but I also check supplementcorner. Sometimes the prices are better there, and they have a lot of different brands, so it's simpler to compare.

So, here's the deal: he finally ordered from Calvitamin, and that's when everything made sense.

This is over a span of 5+ years. I wanted to take it for its sleep/relaxation and muscle benefits.

Every time I've tried magnesium supplementation, I immediately start feeling off. I get lethargic, brain fog, and what feels like pressure in my head and ears, sometimes feels more like a headache. I've tried going on and off of it several times and I always end up feeling the same after a day or two of taking the supplements, so the symptoms are definitely related. Never had any bowel problems and I'm either taking a full dose or 1/3 to 1/2 of a dose.

submission,1krfz5e,,0,What‚Äôs in Your Stack if You Train Hard and also Party a Little Too Hard?,0.5,,"I‚Äôve lurked in here for a while and figured it was finally time to open the floor to advice that goes beyond the typical ‚Äúsleep more, eat better‚Äù type of replies (although yes‚ÄîI‚Äôm working on those too).

I‚Äôm 27, living in a big city, and pretty active. I bike everywhere weather permitting, hit the gym 4/5 days a week, and genuinely enjoy pushing myself physically. My main fitness goals are building lean muscle, staying mentally sharp, and improving recovery so I can keep showing up consistently.

That said, weekends are where structure goes to die. I enjoy a good night out‚Äîdrinks, late nights, junk food. Not ashamed of it, just being honest. I also use Zyn (nicotine pouches) on a daily basis, and while I know the obvious health red flags, I‚Äôm curious if anyone else here has experience balancing that habit while still trying to dial in performance and wellness. I‚Äôve always been more interested in the ‚Äúrealistic optimization‚Äù approach rather than trying to live inside of a wellness vacuum.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently taking:

Morning: 

- Nature's Way Vitamin C
- Sports Research¬Æ Vitamin D3 + K2
- Pure Methylated Multivitamin

Afternoon:

- THORNE Super EPA - Omega-3 Fatty Acids EPA 425mg & DHA 270mg Supplement
- Nature Made Potassium Gluconate 550 mg
- THORNE Zinc Bisglycinate 30mg

Night: 

- KSM-66 Ashwagandha Root Powder Extract
- Magnesium Glycinate 400mg

I was using creatine for a while but I have recently cut it out. The side effects weren‚Äôt terrible but I skipped it for a few nights and found myself feeling more well rested in the AM. 

Also recently signed up for Everyday Dose (the mushroom coffee). I am not sold on it but I don‚Äôt mind the taste and it‚Äôs convenient for mornings that time is limited. The coffee shop by my office charges about $10 for an iced latte with oat milk so everyday dose is actually cheaper. 

What I‚Äôm looking for:

1. Supplement recs for recovery, focus, gut health, or anything that helps smooth out the highs and lows of a work hard/play hard lifestyle.

2.Thoughts on Zyn‚Äîespecially from people who use it and are still optimizing other parts of their health.

3.General feedback from others living actively but not perfectly.

Appreciate any input.

1. Kion Clean Protein: Comes in vanilla and chocolate. Super clean ingredients, grass-fed. 20g prot to 80 kcal/serving. Decent ratio
2. Crazy Nutrition Mass Gainer: Same vanilla and choc flavor options as Kion. 50g protein to 488 kcal per serving is too high!!!!¬†
3. Crazy Nutrition 100% Tri-Protein: Love that it comes in strawberry and choc. But the banana option (ewww) is questionable. 24g protein to 108kcal.
4. Ritual Daily Shake: Only available in vanilla, meh. 20g protein to 120kcal per serving is a bit much but manageable. Is the subscription model worth it? I would also prefer a more extended refund policy
5. Sculpt Nation Protein: Same old vanilla and choc option. For some weird reason both flavors have slightly different ingredient doses. 25g protein to 120 kcal. But artificial flavors? Come on!

submission,1kr6qem,,2,Alg√†demy Astaxanthin vs Vegavero Astaxanthin bio - (early maculopathy) - 63f Looking for advice on astaxanthin supplements for my mom,0.75,,"Hi all,

I hope this is the right subreddit. 
My mom 63 year-old White female has been diagnosed with early maculopathy. The symptoms started about a couple years ago. 
I‚Äôve had thorough eye exams and follow-ups, but nothing conclusive or treatable was found so far. 
She has any major systemic medical issues, doesn't smoke neither drink. 
The doctor suggested she might consider also astaxanthin as part of a supportive antioxidant routine to support retinal health.

I‚Äôm currently considering two main supplements:

1. Alg√†demy Astaxanthin
https://algademy.com/it/home/53-Astaxantina.html

2. Astaxantina BIO (Vegavero)
https://www.vegavero.com/it-p-Astaxantina-BIO


I‚Äôm not entirely sure about the differences between these products in terms of eye-specific effectiveness, quality of raw materials, extraction method, certifications (organic, etc.), and overall value for money.

My main priorities are:

Protective/beneficial effect on the retina
Purity and quality of the extract
Safety and bioavailability
Affordable cost for long-term use


Of course, I‚Äôm following my specialist‚Äôs advice and I understand this sub is mostly visited by professionals, so I‚Äôm not looking for anecdotal experiences but rather insight on whether astaxanthin has clinical relevance in cases like mine, and whether one product might be more suitable than the other based on composition.


Thanks in advance to anyone willing to share their thoughts or advice!

comment,mtfgzm9,1kr3jgr,2,,,0,"You don't say and it is none of my business, just a generic comment, but I think people are more prone to fungal things if your older, and particularly if overweight &/or have blood sugar/metabolic issues (diabetic, prediabetic etc). I'm not a doctor, just an educated guess. So it is good to know your metabolic health status (diabetic, prediabetic, insulin resistant, high A1C heading to diabetes, etc, everything loves to eat sugar including cancer) and always good to keep weight under control.

  
But obviously you did the right thing. Visit a a doc. Because there are millions of skin conditions. And fungus is nasty and tenacious. For all I know fungus may feed on some supplements more than others. Very adaptable. Keep dry, and air'd out is always not a bad idea (I wear sandals no socks in summer for that reason). But with fungus who knows? I Certainly don't. Some skin fungi seem to LIKE (only express) in sun, such as tinea versicolor.  Normally one would assume ""sun and air are always good"" but you can never assume with fungus. But I'd think you can't go wrong IN GENERAL with keeping things clean, dry and blood sugar under control. But when it comes to fungus no such thing as a guarantee. At least from the little I have seen.

That said, as you know I am sure, you can be extremely healthy and get &/or have recurrent issues. Once it occurs assume it can/may/will recur and be vigilant. If you're lucky it may go away ""permanently"" or till you get old when the weakest link in your immunity etc tends to re-express old injuries and ailments. Some times for reasons unknown (except maybe by a doctor but even they are more likely to just say, "" smear this on your skin"" but not know or share why it is recurrent). Like cockroaches fungus will be here eating the plutonium long after we are gone from nuclear Armageddon.

  
I don't know if it is skin PH or what, but sometimes it does seem that a fungi will prefer one person over another when they are both extremely healthy. Living in a humid climate is of course fungus friendly. Tinea versicolor for example (innocuous skin fungus that people may have and not even know they have) can recur to blotch up a nice tan soon as it gets humid. Point is, some fungi, after initial exposure are EXTREMELY hard to ban permanently. Permanently is a very long time. So vigilance is important. You can beat them back for long periods, you may even feel ""gone forever"", but they seem to have a way of recurring, particularly with age because pretty much everything gets worse with age.",Nobody247365,1747807337.0,,,,

While Align Probiotic and Seed Daily Synbiotic are well-known options, I'd like to share my positive experience with Prime Biome, a spore-based probiotic that has truly made a difference for me.

Prime Biome stands out because its spore-based formulation is designed to survive the digestive process and reach the gut alive, where it can effectively support gut health. This resilience is particularly beneficial for those of us dealing with IBS, as it helps balance the gut microbiome and can alleviate symptoms like bloating, gas, and irregular bowel movements.

Since I started using Prime Biome, I've noticed a significant improvement in my digestive comfort and overall gut health. It's been a relief to find something that genuinely works, especially after trying various other options.

If you're open to exploring new possibilities, I highly recommend giving Prime Biome a try. As always, it's a good idea to discuss any new supplement with your healthcare provider to ensure it's the right fit for you.

submission,1kr0ybp,,2,Food supplements: dangerous or counterproductive combinations to absolutely avoid,0.63,,"Hello everyone,

We often talk about the best supplements to take, but rarely about those that should definitely not be combined. However, some associations are counterproductive, disrupt absorption, or can be downright harmful in the long term.

Here is an expanded list of common association errors, with explanations and sources for those who want to dig deeper:


---

1. Zinc + Copper

Excess zinc (>30 mg/day) blocks the absorption of copper ‚Üí risk of deficiency, anemia, nervous disorders.
Solution: Add 1‚Äì2 mg of copper or alternate.
Source: Linus Pauling Institute


---

2. Calcium + Iron

Calcium strongly inhibits the absorption of non-heme iron.
Solution: Space out the shots by several hours.
Source: Hallberg et al., AJCN, 1991


---

3. Magnesium + Zinc / Iron / Calcium

They compete for intestinal absorption.
Solution: Take separately (eg: magnesium in the evening).
Source: NIH ‚Äì Magnesium


---

4. Vitamin C + B12 (high dose)

High doses of vitamin C can break down B12 in the gut if taken together.
Solution: Take 2 hours apart.
Source: NIH ‚Äì B12


---

5. Iron + Curcumin

Turmeric can bind to iron and inhibit its absorption.
Solution: Avoid taking them together.
Source: Funk et al., 2010 ‚Äì Inflammation Research


---

6. Calcium + Magnesium (in high doses)

Beyond 500 mg each, they partially cancel each other out.
Solution: Separate them morning/evening if high dosage.
Source: Saris et al., Magnesium Research, 2000


---

7. Vitamin E (high dose) + Anticoagulants (or omega-3)

Vitamin E has a thinning effect ‚Üí increased risk of bleeding if combined with omega-3 or aspirin.
Solution: Monitor dosages, seek medical advice.
Source: NIH ‚Äì Vitamin E


---

8. Iodine + Selenium (in excess)

Iodine supplementation without sufficient selenium intake can disrupt the thyroid and cause oxidative reactions.
Source: Zimmermann et al., 2007 ‚Äì Thyroid


---

9. Melatonin + 5-HTP

Both influence the production of serotonin/melatonin. Combined, they can create an overly powerful sedative effect or disrupt the serotonergic axis.
Solution: Use one or the other, never at the same time without supervision.
Source: Examine.com ‚Äì Melatonin & 5-HTP


---

10. Vitamin D + K2: OK / D alone: ‚Äã‚Äãlong-term attention

Taking plenty of vitamin D without vitamin K2 could promote arterial calcification.
Solution: Always combine vitamin D3 with K2 in case of prolonged supplementation.
Source: Schurgers et al., 2007 ‚Äì Thrombosis and Haemostasis


---

Bonus: Too much of everything

Even if interactions are managed, stacking 10 to 15 supplements can overwhelm the liver, kidneys, or digestive transporters. Result: ineffectiveness, side effects or energy losses.


---

And you ?

Have you ever made association errors or had unexpected effects?

Do you separate your shots or stack everything at once?

Any other combinations you avoid?


This kind of sharing helps avoid invisible but common mistakes. Looking forward to reading your feedback!

Then there are some funny situations: both vitamin C and B12 improve iron aborbtion, but then you say that vitamin C interferes with vit. B12. So then what is one supposed to do? Choose only one? Which one? And then we return to the first point in my comment: we are not being told the magnitudes of the effect by which vitamin C and vit. B12 improve iron absorbtion and metabolism. If the answer were vitamin C by 50%, and vitamin B12 by only 5%, the choice would be obvious. But we are not being provided those important numbers.",Duduli,1747860347.0,,,,
submission,1kr0tb7,,1,Food supplements: the association errors that (almost) all of us make,0.6,,"Hello everyone,

We often talk about the best supplements to take for this or that objective, but much less about those that should not be taken together. However, certain combinations can reduce effectiveness or even create subtle side effects.

After digging into the subject and testing a lot of things myself, I realized that there are quite a few common mistakes in supplement combinations. Here are some concrete examples (often little known), with supporting sources:


---

1. Zinc vs. Copper
An excess of zinc (often >25-50 mg/day over the long term) can induce a copper deficiency, because they share the same transporters in the intestine. This can lead to neurological and immune disorders.
Source: Linus Pauling Institute - Zinc


---

2. Iron + Calcium
Calcium significantly inhibits the absorption of non-heme iron. Taken together, the effect of iron can be greatly reduced, which is problematic in cases of anemia.
Source: Hallberg et al., 1991 ‚Äì American Journal of Clinical Nutrition


---

3. Antioxidants + Exercise
High doses of vitamins C and E may counteract the beneficial effects of exercise, including the natural production of mitochondria.
Sources:

Gomez-Cabrera et al., 2008 ‚Äì PNAS

Paulsen et al., 2014 ‚Äì Journal of Physiology



---

4. Magnesium + Zinc or Iron
Taken simultaneously, these minerals compete for intestinal absorption, especially at high doses.
Source: NIH Office of Dietary Supplements ‚Äì Magnesium


---

5. Calcium + Magnesium (in high doses)
They also use similar absorption pathways. Taken together at high doses (>500 mg), they may partially interfere with each other. Better to space them out during the day.
Source: Saris et al., 2000 ‚Äì Magnesium Research


---

I tell myself that we often talk about a ‚Äústack‚Äù of supplements, but rarely about real synergies or invisible antagonisms.

My questions for you:

Have you noticed any negative effects (or loss of effectiveness) after certain combinations?

Do you separate your catches during the day according to interactions?

Have you found any truly effective synergies or, on the contrary, mistakes that should absolutely be avoided?


I think we would all benefit from sharing our trials/errors and the data we were able to cross-check.

submission,1kr0oc2,,0,The dilemma of hyper-supplementation: how far to go without doing worse rather than better?,0.5,,"Hello community,

I wanted to start a discussion on a topic that has been on my mind for a while: oversupplementation. You know, this tendency to accumulate several food supplements in the hope of optimizing your health, your shape, your energy... But can we sometimes go too far?

I'm sure many of us have already experienced this phase where we want to ""try everything"": vitamins, minerals, adaptogens, amino acids, antioxidants, probiotics... And then we add this, more that, thinking that it will ""do better"". But in real life, doesn't that risk saturating our liver, our enzymatic system, or even creating unexpected interactions?

A few points I would like to raise:

Have you ever experienced a drop in effectiveness or even side effects after a long time with too many supplements?

Do you know of cases where too many vitamins/minerals turned out to be counterproductive (e.g. excess toxic vitamin A, zinc/copper imbalances, etc.)?

How do you find a good balance without overdosing?

Do you think that the body has a limit to the absorption or use of these molecules, beyond which it can be harmful?

And finally, do you have any strategies for taking ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù or cycles in your supplement routine?


From a scientific point of view, several studies warn of overconsumption:

1. Vitamin A: Chronic excess can lead to liver toxicity, bone pain, and neurological disorders (NIH Office of Dietary Supplements).


2. Zinc/copper: An imbalance caused by excessive zinc intake can lead to copper deficiency, affecting immunity and bone health (Linus Pauling Institute).


3. Metabolic overload: Liver and kidneys have limited capacity to metabolize/excrete these substances, chronic excess can be toxic (reviewed in Journal of Nutrition and Toxicology Reports).


4. Negative interactions: For example, excessively high doses of antioxidants can block natural physiological adaptations, particularly in athletes (Free Radical Biology & Medicine, 2013).



Personally, I have adopted the method of cycles and regular breaks to avoid this saturation, but I find that this subject is rarely discussed in depth, because we mainly talk about the best supplements to take, not enough about ‚Äúwhen to stop‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to avoid overdose‚Äù.

Looking forward to reading your experiences, opinions and advice!

I am, taking Vit E but some research I have done has me questioning whether a supplement is right for me for this, so I do often review my intake and assess it critically.

I often take less than is recommended and do a lot of research before I just add another supplement.

I do sometimes wonder about kidney liver function and I do my bloods regularly which come up looking great every time.

Zinc is a powerful anti inflammatory and has treated my HS disease better than the harsh meds I'm prescribed. It had a bunch of other positive effects as well. All the dry painful cracked skin on my feet softened up and basically came to life, my skin feels amazing, I don't really care much about that being male lol, but the difference is crazy. I also get over bugs and injuries faster and the lack of inflammation in my body has helped with weight loss. Turmeric is the same in a way. It's also a powerful anti inflammatory and I use it to back up the zinc for my HS. Liver complex pills and omega I started taking to help with NAFLD the detox to my liver and improved liver health has also helped with my depression. I've been feeling amazing where before I was highly depressed all the time and never felt motivated to do anything.  They've also dramatically boosted energy levels and left me feeling less fatigued especially in the mornings and last thing at night when I was usually rough every day. And the alpha lipoic acid has helped with weight loss like the zinc. I am on meds I can't stop taking that effect my metabolism and the way my body stores fat. So I've found it impossible to lose weight no matter how much I diet and exercise. With the alpha lipoic acid and zinc my weight is going down and it's going down quite fast. I lost a stone and a half in a month. Which is unhealthily fast really but I assume a chunk of that original weight loss is water weight.

I didn't speak to a representative at first because I didnt want someone to tell me what the benefits were supposed to be.  I wanted to see for myself.  My neice gave me a month's supply and I asked if she had any negative side effects and since she said she didn't,  I took them blindly.  Immediately, I noticed a slight shift in energy levels.  Then my hair loss seemed to go to almost no shedding at all.  As time went on, I wasn't getting all the seasonal illnesses and if I did catch a cold, it didn't hang around long or turn into something I needed antibiotics for.  The biggest change came last year when I decided to quit taking it because I was tired of paying for it.  What a nightmare because all of a sudden, I felt the full weight of perimenopause.  I did not realize I was that close to menopause because there were no gradual symptoms before last year.  Hot flashes every hour, night sweats, my hair falling out, brain fog, insomnia and my hair was thinning terribly.  To top it all off, I came down with flu type B in January and I hadn't had the flu since before I began Juice Plus.  I ordered the product at the end of January and doubled my dosage for the first month.  Hot flashes are almost completely gone, hair loss has slowed way down and all those other nasty menopause symptoms are lessening.

My safety factor was not being able to breathe all the time after falling asleep, depending on position, plugged nose, etc.  My brain got trained that sleep was dangerous, so it would take a really long time, sometimes never sleeping like you now.

submission,1kqzm4t,,2,Should I take high-end multivitamins (like Thorne Research) for lifelong nutritional support? I'm 19M from Pakistan where childhood malnutrition is very common.,0.63,,"Hey everyone,

I'm a 19-year-old male from Pakistan, and I've recently started taking my long-term health more seriously. Growing up here, I‚Äôve seen first-hand how common malnutrition is especially micronutrient deficiencies due to a lack of access to balanced diets and health education.

According to UNICEF and the National Nutrition Survey of Pakistan (2018), **over 40% of children under five are stunted**, **17.7% suffer from wasting**, and **28.9% are underweight**. Even among adults, hidden hunger (micronutrient deficiencies without visible undernutrition) is a serious concern. These deficiencies are often carried into adulthood, especially in lower-middle-income households where diets are heavy on carbs and low in diverse, nutrient-dense foods.

**Source**: [UNICEF: National Nutrition Survey Pakistan 2018]()

Now that I can afford better nutrition, I‚Äôve been researching high-quality multivitamins to fill in the gaps. Brands like **Thorne Research**, **Pure Encapsulations**, **Life Extension** are highly recommended for their bioavailability, quality testing, and transparency.

But here's my question i want to ask:

**Has anyone here (especially from regions with poor childhood nutrition) experienced noticeable differences from taking high-end supplements like Thorne or others?**

 **Should I go with Thorne or is there another top-tier brand that offers better value or results?**

I'm not looking for a shortcut to health, just a solid foundation to build on ‚Äî especially considering possible long-standing nutrient gaps from my earlier years.

Would love to hear your insights and personal experiences!

Thanks in advance",Practical_Sea_3955,1747728977.0,10,Recommendations ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kqzm4t/should_i_take_highend_multivitamins_like_thorne/

I tested it out recently and stopped taking it for a few weeks. Yesterday I took a 3% thymoquinone extract version and sure enough I turned into a neurotic mess within an hour.

I‚Äôve read this could be due to the fact that it raises acetylcholine and GABA (which converts back into glutamate), and I do suspect my OCD is connected to a glutamate imbalance. But what‚Äôs weird is most people seem to experience anti-anxiety effects from BSO and other GABAergic substances don‚Äôt give me neuroticism. In fact, they typically do the opposite and make me very chilled out.  And I can take other acetylcholine supps without issue - even stimulants. 

Anyone else experience these symptoms or have any advice on how to avoid them if I choose to continue taking black seed? It has so many other benefits, it‚Äôs a shame that I seem to be having this side effect.

I‚Äôm looking to add a high-quality B-complex supplement to my stack and wanted to get your input based on experience and research.

My main goals are:
	‚Ä¢	Energy support
	‚Ä¢	Cognitive function
	‚Ä¢	Mood balance
	‚Ä¢	Maybe some stress resilience

Ideally, I‚Äôm looking for:
	‚Ä¢	Activated forms (like methylcobalamin, P-5-P, methylfolate instead of folic acid, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Clean ingredient profile (no artificial dyes, unnecessary fillers, or megadosing)
	‚Ä¢	Trusted brand with good bioavailability
	‚Ä¢	Reasonable price for the value

So far, I‚Äôve seen some positive mentions of:
	‚Ä¢	Jarrow Formulas B-Right
	‚Ä¢	Pure Encapsulations B-Complex Plus
	‚Ä¢	Thorne Research Basic B Complex
	‚Ä¢	Garden of Life mykind Organics
	‚Ä¢	Solgar B-Complex ‚Äú100‚Äù

If you‚Äôve tried any of these or have other suggestions (especially if you noticed actual results), I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.
Also curious if anyone here cycles B-complex or takes it daily?

Thanks in advance!

submission,1kqmyem,,0,What caused blood in my urine?,0.4,,"39 year old male.

For about 6 weeks I was taking the following stack to clear viral terrain and improve immune resilience:

Nattokinase ‚Äì 2000FU daily (1 cap, fasted) upped to 4000FU about 5 days before pink urine.

Vitamin C ‚Äì 2‚Äì6 g daily (split into 2 g √ó 3 doses: fasted, post-meal, before bed)

NAC ‚Äì 600 mg daily (usually fasted)

Quercetin ‚Äì 500 mg daily (post-meal)

Magnesium Glycinate ‚Äì 200mg nightly (before bed)

Zinc ‚Äì 30 mg daily (post-meal)

Potassium Citrate ‚Äì 300 mg daily (post-meal)

Black Seed Oil ‚Äì ~1 tsp daily (post-meal, optional)

Collagen Peptides ‚Äì 10‚Äì15 g (taken before bed for tissue repair)

5-HTP ‚Äì 100 mg ‚Äî before bed (support mood + serotonin/testosterone relationship)

For the last 3 days of that regime I also introduced a second stack for testosterone optimisation/hormone balancing:

Tongkat Ali ‚Äì 600 mg ‚Äî fasted (morning)

Boron ‚Äì 6 mg ‚Äî fasted (morning)

DIM (Diindolylmethane) ‚Äì 200 mg ‚Äî post-meal

2 days after I had increased the nattokinase dosage and just introduced the testosterone optimisation stack I had noticed a slightly pale pink hue to my urine when it collected in the bowl. Not enough to make me think that it was blood.

On the third day my morning pee (before taking supplements) was a definite light red / pink, indicating blood in urine.

I stopped every supplement, caffeine and anything but water since (in terms of liquids) and have not had any reoccurrence. All regular.

I had two priorities in these stacks. One, to clear viral terrain as I'm convinced that the Covid-19 virus has temporarily decreased our viral resistance, and two, to assist in increasing my free testosterone and reducing estrogen dominance.

What caused the blood in the urine? Was it the nattokinase breaking down any fibrous clotting in the kidneys? Was it too much of everything or the combination of everything? I realise this sub is not all medical professionals, so it's just your opinion I'm looking for because I'm really not sure.

I'm leaving it a fortnight and then going to reintroduce the safest supplements very gradually like collagen, vitamin C, zinc and see how I get on.

comment,mt70t3i,1kqmyem,2,,,1,"From an article online from 2022:

'Something often put forth is that DIM is hard to absorb. This is not consistent with our long-standing experience. You see DIM causes changes in urine colour, producing a reddy-pink or orange hue, and if it wasn't being absorbed from the GI tract, there would be no change present. Yet even those people taking their DIM first thing in the morning on an empty stomach report these same changes. Still, to improve absorption it is suggested you take your DIM with meals.'

I'm really hoping this is it! Makes sense - the timing adds up perfectly.

submission,1kqm5bg,,1,"Preworkout and Creatine. Does anyone take both? If so, what do you use?",1.0,,"Hi everyone. For the first time in years I've been consistently going to the gym. Right now, my MAIN goal is to lose body fat (currently 5'11, and weigh about 270 pounds), but I'm also trying to just build muscle and get stronger.

I'm interested in taking preworkout. I've taken C4 a few times now but it doesn't seem to do much for me at all. I'm looking for something a little stronger, but there are so many options that it seems overwhelming. There are also some that have the same amount of caffeine as like 3-6 cups of coffee, and that just seems crazy, but again, I'm new to the pre workout thing so maybe that's normal?

I'm also interested in taking creatine. I know a lot of pre workouts have some creatine, but usually not enough to reach most peoples goals. I think it's recommended to take 5g of creatine per day and many pre workouts have less than that.

So I guess I'm asking for recommendations as well as experience here. Does anyone take BOTH pre workout and creatine, and if so, what do you take? How does it affect you? Thanks in advance.",STL-Raven,1747686229.0,5,Recommendations ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kqm5bg/preworkout_and_creatine_does_anyone_take_both_if/

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been lurking here for a while and wanted to finally share my current stack and ask for feedback. I‚Äôm a 24 y/o male, high-functioning with formally diagnosed ADHD (combined type) and likely ASD-1 (in process of evaluation). I‚Äôm also very physically active ‚Äî train BJJ, MMA, Muay Thai, and lift 3x a week. My main goals are cognitive support (executive function, working memory), emotional regulation, and sensory stability.

I tend to hyperfocus (monotropic attention) and lean toward rigid but deeply passionate thinking, which fits with high-masking ASD/ADHD profiles. I‚Äôve also struggled with emotional flooding, delayed processing, and restlessness under overstimulation.

üî¨ Current Stack (May 2025)

üíä Morning:
	‚Ä¢	L-Tyrosine (500‚Äì1000mg) w/ B6 & B12 ‚Äì for dopamine precursor support alongside Adderall
	‚Ä¢	Adderall XR (15mg) ‚Äì prescribed, taken weekdays only
	‚Ä¢	CDP-Choline (250mg) ‚Äì memory, focus, and synergy with stimulants
	‚Ä¢	Tongkat Ali (400mg) ‚Äì helps with motivation and dopaminergic drive (cycling)
	‚Ä¢	Fish Oil/DHA ‚Äì brain health + emotional stability
	‚Ä¢	Uridine Monophosphate (150mg) (considering adding) ‚Äì support for neurogenesis and motivation

‚òÄÔ∏è Midday:
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin D3 (5000 IU)
	‚Ä¢	CoQ10 (100mg)
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin E (as tocotrienols)
	‚Ä¢	Lion‚Äôs Mane (1g dual extract) ‚Äì for NGF, long-term plasticity (monitoring for histamine/overstimulation)
	‚Ä¢	Magnesium L-Threonate (Magtein, 2g split dose) ‚Äì cognitive support, synaptic density
	‚Ä¢	Iron (25mg) + Vitamin C ‚Äì energy, anemia prevention
	‚Ä¢	Zinc‚ÄìCopper blend (cycled)

üåô Evening:
	‚Ä¢	Ashwagandha (KSM-66 w/ PharmaGABA) ‚Äì stress and cortisol management
	‚Ä¢	L-Theanine (200mg) ‚Äì sleep and GABAergic calming
	‚Ä¢	CBD/CBN tincture (cycled 2‚Äì3x/week) ‚Äì sensory reset, supports ASD-related insomnia
	‚Ä¢	Magnesium Glycinate (400mg) ‚Äì muscular and emotional relaxation
	‚Ä¢	Phosphatidylserine (100‚Äì200mg) ‚Äì memory, cortisol regulation, mood

ADHD/ASD-1 stack focused on:
	‚Ä¢	Executive functioning & working memory
	‚Ä¢	Mood & sensory stability
	‚Ä¢	Dopaminergic drive & neuroplasticity

I'm 27 years old & suffered from severe Vitamin B12 & Vitamin-D deficiency. This was mostly duo to nitrous oxide and my lifestyle.

  
I also smoked A LOT, haven't eaten properly for many years, was under constant stress & simply did everything to damage my body.

  
Not only do I have severe nerve damage all across my body (I can't feel anything tbh) I also suffer from muscle weakness/paralysis duo to nitrous oxide, false supplementation or god knows what happened. My eyes are gettting bad, I lose my hearing, I can not sleep for 7 months, I lose my hair on so on; it's miserable.

  
In 2 days I will do a big lab test to rule out the most important vitamins and minerals for deficiencies; yet I'm aware of the fact that even if I supplement everything properly, it won't change my life all of a sudden.

  
I still decided to go for this threat to be posted in the supplements group since there are a lot of people in here which may got ideas. 

  
I want my old body back & doctors visits don't bring any results anyway, all my MRIs and Bloodwork has been clear so far.

  
So give me your best advices, general supplementation tips, recovery stories and so on, I absolutely need that right now. Thank you

Start with changing your mindset, you seem to have a self doubts and that is perfectly normal but just remember you will only ever feel as good as you think you should feel. Next up is diet, full balanced healthy meals and prioritize sleep. If you can‚Äôt sleep well at night maybe try to meditate before bed and look into sleepy tea. Additionally, exercising is huge for the body and might actually help with sleep problems. Consuming caffeine early in the day and not after 12pm may help. Build a routine around being healthy, journaling, tracking moods, triggers and things that seem to set you back and avoid them. A healthy lifestyle starts with a positive mindset followed by routine. You can slowly incorporate more things later. Remember nothing  happens over night so go easy on yourself.

 Malkangni‚Äôs shown neuroprotective, anti-anxiety, and GABA-modulating properties in several preclinical studies. It acts as a cognitive enhancer and mood stabilizer by protecting against oxidative stress and regulating neurotransmitters like GABA and serotonin.

Brahmi‚Äôs been studied too  it boosts brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and supports synaptic repair, crucial when mold and Lyme wreck your neurological function, pairing adaptogens like these with magnesium glycinate, L-theanine, and maybe some light mindfulness or breathwork can start resetting that baseline over time.

submission,1kqgsyd,,213,My top 10 takeaways from Rhonda Patrick's new episode about vitamin D decreasing dementia risk by 40%,0.98,,"So a [new study](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/vitamin-d-dementia) came out recently following 12,000+ adults showing people who supplemented with vitamin D had a **40% lower risk of dementia over 10 years**. Rhonda just put out a video covering it. I think the biggest takeaway is this: start taking vitamin D if you aren't (get a blood test first obviously, but so many people are deficient and it's a massive low-hanging fruit)

1. Something like \~70% of Americans have insufficient vitamin D levels (optimal blood levels are 40-60 ng/mL) - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpFOA1AUFCk&t=851s)
2. Usually, **supplementing with 1,000 IU of vitamin D raises blood levels by 5 ng/mL**
3. Vitamin D is so much more than a vitamin‚Ä¶ it gets converted into a steroid hormone that regulates over 1,000 genes in the body - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpFOA1AUFCk&t=46s)
4. **A 70-year old makes four times (!!) less vitamin D from the sun than a 20-year old.** So I guess as you get older, you need a supplement even more.
5. OK‚Ä¶ so the study (12,000+ people) found that just taking a vitamin D supplement (the form didn't matter) was associated with **40% lower risk of dementia over 10 years** \- [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpFOA1AUFCk&t=495s)
6. The ApoE4 allele is a super strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Something like 25% of the population has at least one copy (having 1 ApoE4 allele doubles dementia risk and having 2 copies increases risk by up to tenfold). - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpFOA1AUFCk&t=681s)
7. In the study, taking vitamin D reduced dementia incidence by 33% among ApoE4 carriers and 47% among non-carriers
8. **Vitamin D deficiency actually accelerates brain aging**‚Ä¶ basically, if you're deficient, you're more likely to have damage to the ""white matter"" in your brain. That's apparently important for cognition and memory. - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpFOA1AUFCk&t=344s)
9. Women probably benefit most from vitamin D supplements - they get Alzheimer's 2x as often as men - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpFOA1AUFCk&t=598s)
10. In the study, even for people already experiencing cognitive decline, vitamin D supplementation was associated with 15% lower dementia prevalence (this may mean vitamin D may help slow cognitive decline and delay the progression toward dementia) - [timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpFOA1AUFCk&t=649s)",biohacker045,1747673832.0,43,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kqgsyd/my_top_10_takeaways_from_rhonda_patricks_new/

Of course, they all had subpar levels and each one tested was subjected to massive weekly and monthly injections and almost all the families agreed to it because they were told bringing the Vit D levels up would bring back the cognition. Sigh...

\*Scams. They had an eye doctor who told the families they had to cover all costs for an exam, but it was worth it because once their loved ones could see clearly, their dementia would regress or disappear. As it was a memory care facility and all of the patients were in their 80s and 90s, and many had to be supported/propped in chairs, wheeled around, and fed/diapered by staff, this was unlikely, yet everyone examined was prescribed glasses. Medicare was billed by the doctor, but the families had to buy the glasses and most paid a token to the ""wonderful"" doctor. But the patients constantly threw away or dropped and rolled over the glasses and no one 'woke' from their advanced dementia state. They did the same with hearing aids, specialty replacement meals, something called Magic Pudding and Magic Shakes. Guaranteed to help their loved ones regain their memories. My FIL fell for each one, spent untold thousands for all of these.",Careless-Painter4608,1747677911.0,,,,

Drop your personal supplement tier list in the comments - even if it's just the top 5 you swear by or a full S-F ranking. Feel free to add:

1. Dosages that worked for you

2. What you used each supplement for (e.g., sleep, anxiety, strength, immunity, etc.)

3. Any relevant context (diet, lifestyle, deficiencies, etc.)


Example Format (you can follow or modify):

S Tier ‚Äì Magnesium Glycinate (400mg), Omega-3 (2g EPA+DHA), Creatine (5g)  
A Tier ‚Äì Ashwagandha (600mg KSM-66), Vitamin D3 (2000 IU)  
B Tier ‚Äì NAC (600mg), Zinc Picolinate (25mg)  
C Tier ‚Äì Melatonin (0.5mg), GABA  
D Tier ‚Äì B-Complex, Multivitamins  
F Tier ‚Äì Glutamine, Raspberry Ketones

submission,1kqc5nb,,65,Why Supplement Quality is CRUCIAL (and What You Should Absolutely Avoid,0.86,,"
Hello everyone,

Over the past few years, I've really looked into supplementation to optimize my health ‚Äî and I quickly realized that not all supplements are equal. Some products sold as ""good for you"" are actually full of toxic additives, unnecessary excipients and potentially harmful substances in the long term.

I wanted to share here a list of the worst components to absolutely avoid, which are unfortunately still too often found in low-end supplements.


---

Additives, excipients and contaminants to absolutely avoid:

1. Titanium dioxide (E171)

Used as a white dye.

Potential carcinogen classified by the EU, banned in food in France since 2020.

Still present in capsules, coatings or tablets.


2. Talc (magnesium silicate)

Slip agent.

Suspected of containing asbestos in its natural state.

Useless, purely technical.


3. PEG (polyethylene glycol)

Used as a binder or coating.

Substance from petrochemicals, sometimes irritant or allergenic.


4. Magnesium stearate

Lubricant for machines.

Controversy: some believe it can disrupt intestinal absorption.

To be avoided in the interests of purity, especially if it is of dubious origin.


5. Artificial colors (E102, E104, E110, etc.)

Used to make capsules attractive.

Some are neurotoxic, allergenic, and endocrine disruptors.


6. Artificial flavors and sweeteners (aspartame, sucralose, acesulfame K, etc.)

Common in powders such as proteins, collagen, creatine.

Impact on the microbiota, metabolism and possible insulin effect.


7. Synthetic silica (E551)

Anti-caking.

Avoid in excess, because in nano form in certain cases.


8. Hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils

Still used as a support in certain capsules.

Cardiovascular risk, pro-inflammatory.


9. Heavy metal contamination (lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury)

Risk present in poorly controlled plant supplements, or poor quality algae (spirulina, chlorella).


10. Capsules of untraced animal origin

Coming from non-organic cattle or pigs, without traceability or control.

Risk of drug or pesticide residues.



---

What I recommend:

Read the labels until the end.

Choose brands that clearly indicate:

No additives

Organic or natural ingredients

Traceability

Certification (AB, ISO, GMP, etc.)


Opt for brands like Dynveo, Nutrivita, Nutripure, Sunday Natural, etc. (not sponsored, just feedback).



---

Conclusion :

A poorly formulated supplement is a daily microdose of toxic substances in your body. Conversely, a pure and well-chosen supplement becomes a real therapeutic tool. Take care of what you put in your body, especially when it‚Äôs supposed to make you feel good.

Share your experiences or your favorite brands in the comments!

comment,mt4i9ug,1kqc5nb,23,,,0,"Your last point about heavy metals should be number one by a mile. The doses of heavy metals one can get from supplements is a big valid concern. I'm looking for proper third party lab tested COA's publicly displayed on the manufactures website. I will be looking for the lab used, signature on the COA and that it shows how much of each heavy metal was present. Many fake COA's floating around today.

I'm not the slightest bit concerned with Magnesium Stearate since its used as a flow agent which means very low amounts will be in the end product. We will get a ton more from food sources. People make this one out to be some evil thing but once you realize how much one gets from diet vs supplements it seems rather obvious its not a valid concern as its factors less.

I also do not see an issue with Silicon dioxide as an anti caking agent. You didn't list it specifically but its the one I prefer.

If you look into the amount of coloring used to dye pills is remarkedly small amounts. Unless one is allergic to the dye there is likely zero downside at these miniscule doses.

A little known secret is everyone uses flow agents and anti caking agents. I would much prefer a company that says they use Magnesium Stearate vs one that lists no flow or caking agents because I know for a fact they have to use something.",Ashamed-Status-9668,1747664054.0,,,,

submission,1kqbkdx,,8,"Stopped drinking alcohol and went on a health kick, now worried I take too many supplements.",0.9,,"First, I understand the best thing to answer this question is a blood test. That‚Äôs next on my list. 

But, that aside, I am 40+ female with a background in collegiate sports. I‚Äôve been varying levels of active and dialed in since then (including periods of not at all), but decided to make a big change about 6 mos ago. Almost completely cut out alcohol, dialed in my diet and track everything from exercise, macros and glucose. I work out intensely 5-6 days per week and have varying levels of physicality with my job. 

I fear I‚Äôve replaced junk food and alcohol with the excitement of supplements so I‚Äôd love a review. I love data and tinkering. 

My goal is to slow aging, repair damage and make my body more efficient. Better sleep, better performance, better skin and better recovery. I‚Äôm not looking to become 20, just be good for my age. I don‚Äôt intend on being a triathlete, just strong and healthy. The aesthetics are fine, but really just want to function like my best self. I‚Äôm also at an age of hormone changes, so want to give my body what it needs. 

Here‚Äôs my (very long) stack. Since I eat relatively healthy and take a lot of supplements, I almost never take the full dose incase of overloading and fat soluble vs water. Some of these I take daily, some a few times per week so I do not overdo it. 

Workout/recovery: 
protein shake
Perfect Aminos
Primal Queen beef organs 
Liposomal NAD+ (perpetual life AEON black, has lots of stuff in it) 
Urolithin A
Preworkout w bcaa and EAA
Creatine HCL
Liposomal glutathione 
Silverfern‚Äôs Build

Regular regimen: 
D/K2
omega 3
methylated B complex
Collagen supplement + collagen peptides 
(Many of my supplements have multivitamin-type profile so I rarely take an actual multi) 
Greens 

Skin:
Cymbiotica glow 

Sleep:
Cortisol support ( ashwaganda, rhodiola, magnesium, phosphatidylserine, magnolia bark)
perpetual life white (lots of stuff in it) 

Gut health (this has always been an issue for me)
Digestive enzymes 
Upper GI support 
Motility
immunoglobulin cleanse
All from Silverfern 

That‚Äôs right. The supplement industry loves me. ü´£ what do you think?

comment,mt4e0q8,1kqbkdx,2,,,4,"I was curious about this comment because my supplement stack is massive (I have a number of serious health problems I‚Äôm trying to address), so I  took the question to ChatGPT to try and get more clarity, asking it to comment on a screenshot of your post and this reply. This is the response (and sorry twinpeaks2112 that it‚Äôs a little rough in its response to you‚Äî I‚Äôm not meaning for this to be negative commentary on your comment‚Äî was just looking for clarification and figured I‚Äôd share it).

ChatGPT:

The Reddit commenter‚Äôs warning about potential liver overload is a common concern in discussions about large supplement stacks‚Äîbut let‚Äôs unpack it more critically.

Is the concern about liver overload valid?

Partially valid, but overly simplistic and alarmist without context.

Key Points to Consider:

1. Liver Detox Capacity
	‚Ä¢	The liver does process most xenobiotics (foreign substances, including supplements), but it‚Äôs incredibly efficient and has a large reserve capacity.
	‚Ä¢	For most healthy individuals, taking supplements‚Äîeven in a moderate to large stack‚Äîdoes not automatically lead to liver damage.
	‚Ä¢	However, chronic high-dose use of certain compounds (e.g., fat-soluble vitamins like A and D, herbal extracts, or high-dose niacin) can strain liver detox pathways or build up over time.

2. Overlap & Redundancy
	‚Ä¢	The OP takes several liposomal products and multi-ingredient blends (e.g., AEON Black, Perpetual Life White), each of which may contain overlapping nutrients.
	‚Ä¢	Repetition of active ingredients (like B vitamins, adaptogens, or antioxidants) could lead to megadosing unintentionally.
	‚Ä¢	That‚Äôs not necessarily dangerous short term, but over time, it might lead to:
	‚Ä¢	Nutrient imbalances
	‚Ä¢	Liver enzyme elevations
	‚Ä¢	Tolerance or reduced benefit from some herbs

3. Formulation Burden
	‚Ä¢	Each supplement introduces carriers, excipients, and delivery systems (liposomes, capsules, gums, emulsifiers).
	‚Ä¢	Stacking 20+ supplements daily introduces a chemical burden your liver and gut must handle‚Äîeven if most ingredients are benign.

4. Individual Susceptibility
	‚Ä¢	The OP is healthy, active, and self-aware (not taking full doses daily, monitors diet, plans labs)‚Äîthis lowers their risk significantly.
	‚Ä¢	If there were underlying liver disease, sluggish detox pathways (e.g., genetic variants like slow COMT or GST), or high alcohol/drug history, concern would be greater.

‚∏ª

A Balanced View:

Pros of the OP‚Äôs Approach:
	‚Ä¢	Smart: Self-monitoring, spacing out doses, rotating supplements.
	‚Ä¢	Health-conscious: Diet is dialed in, exercise is consistent.
	‚Ä¢	Introspective: Aware of the psychological pull to ‚Äúreplace alcohol with wellness addiction.‚Äù

Risks to Watch:
	‚Ä¢	Redundancy across supplements (especially methylated B vitamins, antioxidants, herbal extracts).
	‚Ä¢	Liposomal and multi-formula products increasing total intake unknowingly.
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúAlways-on‚Äù supplement mode without cycling or breaks could lead to desensitization or dependency.

‚∏ª

Recommendations (If OP Were a Client):
	1.	Do bloodwork: CMP (liver enzymes), homocysteine, vitamin D, B12, folate, ferritin, omega-3 index.
	2.	Track supplement ingredients in a spreadsheet to catch overlaps.
	3.	Cycle certain categories: e.g., 3 weeks on / 1 week off adaptogens, NAD+ boosters, liposomal antioxidants.
	4.	Take ‚Äúsupplement holidays‚Äù monthly to assess baseline.
	5.	Focus on root causes and avoid using supplements as a substitute for lifestyle refinement.

‚∏ª

In summary:
The Reddit commenter raises a valid concern about potential liver burden, but their delivery is overstated. The OP‚Äôs situation doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúimpending liver failure,‚Äù but continued stacking without structure or awareness could lead to problems over time. With the right lab monitoring and strategic cycling, their regimen can be optimized safely.",happymechanicalbird,1747662679.0,,,,

Stopped consuming tru niagen in January of 2022 at 900 mg a day, and began consuming liposomal NR, cutting my monthly costs in half but maintaining or slightly improving my positive impacts at 600 mg a day. 

NAD+ is one of the most important biochemicals in the body, important for energy, DNA repair, and sirtuin production. Main supplier of NAD+ in the body are the salvage pathways in every cell's nucleus and cytosol. 

You can improve NAD+ production in multiple ways, including consuming an NAD+ precursor like NMN, NR, or niacin, doing resistance training, which improves the synthesis of NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathways, and consuming things like apigenin, to decrease NAD+ consumption by ectoenzymes like cd38.",vauss88,1747675062.0,,,,

Also, when I say it gave me energy, you need to understand I was having trouble just getting through my day and a 20 minute walk was the most exercise I could manage. In fact I couldn't even do that until I started rhe B2 and B1 Benfotiamine. This isn't the same as "" can use a little more energy"".

comment,mu0fluo,1kq68ah,1,,,0,"Vitamin D & Hypothyroidism: Why Sun Exposure Isn't Enough. Here's a quick summary: 

I struggled with hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. Despite spending a lot of time in the sun, my vitamin D levels remained low. 

My doctor initially prescribed vitamin D2 , which is why I added that piece in here in case anybody else has a doctor that does that so you could understand why.  And it did work for me personally, but once the numbers go into the normal range, she stopped prescribing   I had to find a better solution and this is actually way better. My numbers went back up and I never had a problem since very affordable as you could see  

[Vitamin D3 50,000 IU 15 pills. 1x a week so almost 4 months worth for $11.00 ü§©](https://shopoubremedical.myshopify.com/products/copy-of-vitamin-d3-50-000)


The Triple Problem with Hypothyroidism
Absorption Issues 

( I've combined my personal experience with additional information that may be relevant. I included my doctor's note regarding my hypothyroidism to highlight how thyroid issues can trigger numerous other health problems, including vitamin D deficiencies. It's possible that parathyroid or calcium-related issues could also be a factor. This is important to consider.  

I would report your doctor. This is egregious negligence - I‚Äôll list below this comment how things progressed rapidly and to dangerous levels as a result of my waiting it out  - if I had taken care of it sooner, I wouldn‚Äôt have had the long painful process  that I had. 
 your doctor is completely negligent. This is nothing to just write off)

Hypothyroidism impairs intestinal absorption of vitamin D from food and supplements

Thyroid hormones regulate gut function and intestinal barrier integrity

Conversion Problems
Body can't effectively activate vitamin D (convert 25(OH)D to active 1,25(OH)2D3)
CYP27B1 enzyme (converts vitamin D to active form) is affected by thyroid dysfunction
Polymorphisms in CYP27B1 gene associated with autoimmune thyroid disease

Weight Gain Factor
Hypothyroidism typically causes weight gain
Obesity causes fat cells to bind vitamin D, preventing blood absorption
Creates additional barrier to adequate vitamin D levels

Individual Variation in Sun Response
Some people have variable responsiveness to UVB radiation
Can result in low vitamin D despite abundant sun exposure (3+ hours daily)
Study found 51% of high-sun-exposure individuals still had vitamin D below 30 ng/ml

Key Solutions

Immediate Actions
Take D3 supplements (not D2) - more absorbable
Get new doctor - level of 9 is dangerously low, should be 30+
High-dose prescription D3 may be needed initially

Additional Considerations
Check for underlying absorption disorders (Crohn's, celiac, etc.)

Consider magnesium supplement (helps activate vitamin D)
Address thyroid condition as primary issue

Why Doctors Prescribe D2
More readily available in high prescription doses (50,000 IU)
Historical standard, despite D3 being more effective
Insurance/formulary preferences

Bottom Line
Sun exposure alone won't fix severe deficiency when there are absorption or conversion problems from hypothyroidism. The thyroid acts as a catalyst for multiple health issues - fix it first.

submission,1kq267v,,4,New to vitamin supplementation - Need help with dosage (D3 and magnesium),0.84,,"Hello everyone, 

I'm pretty new to vitamin supplementation and had a few things I wanted to clear up before buying the supplements. 

Currently, my Vitamin D3 serum level is at 24 nmol/L. I weight60 kg, am 173cm tall, and am a 21 year old male. 

I started looking into dosage amounts to get my levels to an optimal level 75-100 nmol/L (i think) and landed on a dosage of 10,000 IU for  4-6 weeks (or 5000 IU for 3-4 months) followed by 2000 IU to maintain (with K2 of course). My GP recommended taking a weekly dose but he didn't specify the amount and also mentioned that he was still deficient despite taking the same amount himself for a while, so I'm not sure what the right dosage for me might be. 

As for the magnesium supplement, I looked into the different kinds of magnesium supplements and found that malate might be the best choice for me since the reason I even got tested in the first place was cause i feel pretty fatigued most of the time and was feeling like I wasn't recovering well after my gym sessions. But I'm unsure of what dosage to take. 

My GP did mention that from my blood test, everything else besides my Vitamin D level was good - not sure if that helps but I thought I'd mention it regardless.

Thank you",slimepath,1747625792.0,5,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kq267v/new_to_vitamin_supplementation_need_help_with/

comment,mt2gegc,1kq267v,3,,,0,"The right amount of d3 is different for everyone, ¬†regardless of deficiency. ¬† Some people absorb it very poorly and stay on 10000iU indefinitely. ¬† Others (like myself) managed to raise their levels with less (2000iu for me) and got side effects from higher doses. ¬†¬†

But 10000iu certainly won‚Äôt hurt you in the short term, ¬†especially when paired with magnesium and k2. ¬† My advice would to start with the 10000 daily as you planned, ¬†and assuming you can tolerate it,¬†¬†then get your levels retested after a month to see how you‚Äôre responding.

As for the magnesium, ¬†start with at least 200mg of supplemental if you‚Äôre taking any sort of d3. ¬† That might be enough, ¬†but you‚Äôll know for sure when you increase the magnesium level. ¬† Try bumping it up slowly to 400-600mg to see what your body needs. ¬† ¬†The more d3 you take the more need you‚Äôll have for supplemental mag, ¬†but it‚Äôs also diet dependent. ¬† ¬† ¬†If you take too much it‚Äôll give you loose stools, ¬†and a feel of apathy. ¬† From my own experience: ¬†start low and go slow, ¬† You‚Äôll know when you had too much. ¬† ¬† And malate is a good choice, ¬† but can interfere with sleep if taken at night. ¬† Consider citrate if you want to use it for sleep.",AccomplishedNet7223,1747626990.0,,,,
comment,mt2jtvq,1kq267v,2,,,0,"Any dose you take will eventually plateau. Vitamin D dosage correlates with blood level on a curve, meaning that 10K IU will not increase your level by double the amount that 5K IU does.

The higher loading dose and then lower maintenance dose approach is valid, but it can be tricky to dial in because it's possible that your maintenance dose may not be enough to keep your level where you want it after a few years.

It also backfires for some people who will experience minor side effects from vitamin D due to a lack of magnesium or the body acclimating after being deficient for so long.

Given that it's going to take a while to get your level up and symptoms to resolve, I think the simplest approach is to pick a dose that will get you to and maintain where you want to be. Retesting after 2-3 months can tell you if you need to adjust it.

A good guideline for picking that dose is **100 IU per kg**, so 6K IU daily of vitamin D3 for you. You can always increase it later.

I would aim for a higher vitamin D level, over 125 nmol/L.

Magnesium intake should factor in your diet aka eat more magnesium rich foods. Malate is a good pick for morning dosing. It's best to work your dose up in increments and split it up. Ex, start with ~100 mg in the morning, then add ~100 mg around lunch, and increase those doses if you need to.",VitaminDJesus,1747628654.0,,,,
comment,mt2itfr,1kq267v,2,,,1,"Sweet, ill try 10000 IU for a bit and then get retested and decide what to do afterwards. I'll probably go with  a 200g magnesium supplement since I think i get around 200g+ already just from my diet.

comment,mt2qbss,1kq267v,1,,,2,"I'd personally add in 3mg of boron additionally to magnesium and k2 to help absorb it correctly

also newer information says it's better to be around 150-170 not just 75-100 so that's what I'd aim for for optimal health

comment,mt45lf3,1kpy50t,2,,,2,"It causes inflammation when consumed in excess, which leads to all sorts of chronic diseases.

It also causes fat cells to absorb more blood sugar.

Humans traditionally consumed a diet which varied between a ratio of 1:1 to 1:4 omega 3 to Omega 6, which is fine.

Generally in temperate climates human diets would contain less omega 6 during the spring and summer, more omega 6 in the fall and winter. Basically, humans would tend to add a bit of ""winter weight"" in the fall and winter, then lose it in the spring. This was a good thing, a survival mechanism.

However, seed oils and fats from non-ruminant animals fed modern conventional feed contain far more omega 6 than omega 3. Due to the prevalence of these items in a typical American diet year round (and in many modern diets around the world) people are eating diets with a ratio of 1:25 to 1:40 omega 3 to omega 6. I've seen estimates that the typical American diet derives 25% of its calories from seed oils, which is unprecedented in human history.

The human body is not adapted to this ratio, and it leads to chronic inflammation, obesity, fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, metabolic dysfunction, and many other ""modern"" chronic diseases.

If someone were to somehow eat a diet with too little omega 6, then supplementation could be beneficial, though you'd need to ensure that the omega 6 fatty acids did not oxidize during processing and manufacturing of the supplement. However, it's practically impossible to eat a diet with less omega 6 than omega 3.

If you'd like to see published scientific papers on topics mentioned here, let me know.

So yes, supplementing omega 6 is literally harmful to human health.",Katsuo__Nuruodo,1747659716.0,,,,

My belief is that people should do at least a little research before posting on science-related topics. The average American is deficient, even perhaps if they do take a magnesium supplement because our bodies only absorb 20-50% of what we eat. Here are some reasons for the magnesium deficiency:

* Dry roasting nuts removes the highly nutritious oils which contain magnesium.
* Milling flour from grains strips magnesium from the grain.
* Sugar in anything uses up magnesium.
* Fluoridated, softened, and distilled water depletes magnesium.
* Carbonated beverages and some processed foods, like lunch meat, contain phosphates that bind to magnesium molecules and flush it out of the body.
* Alcohol blocks magnesium, especially if you have three or more drinks a day.
* Coffee works like a diuretic to flush magnesium from of the body.
* Some foods‚Äîlike raw or roasted nuts and seeds, soybeans, spinach, and chard‚Äîcontain compounds called phytic acid and oxalic acid which can cause magnesium to be eliminated from the body.

comment,mt5yc41,1kpy50t,1,,,4,"To begin with, I'd like to be clear that I'm not a doctor or dietician, so I'd encourage you to do your own research. I've done much of my own.

I'm not familiar with the benefits/detriments of CLA.

Upon a bit of searching, I see that there are multiple different forms of CLA. For example, there's the CLA you find naturally occurring in beef, dairy, and other ruminant meat and milk. Then there's the CLA manufactured from seed oils, and this is the CLA predominantly found in supplements. These two types have different molecular forms, so they may have different effects on health.

While it is a trans fat, it is a naturally occurring one (at least the CLA found in ruminant meat and dairy), which tend to not have the same detrimental effects on health as the manufactured trans fats that were rightfully banned in the US (and other countries) some years ago.

According to WebMD, there isn't much evidence that supplementing CLA has any significant health benefits in humans. Some animal tests were positive, but running the same tests in humans produced mixed results at best. On top of that, it can increase inflammation, reduce insulin sensitivity, and may increase cardiovascular disease risk.

""CLA supplements may not provide the same benefits as CLA from food.""

https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-cla

While I haven't reviewed any papers on this topic myself, I'd avoid manufactured CLA.

Humans have been eating beef and dairy for a very long time, so it's likely that the naturally occurring forms of CLA you get from these foods are fine to consume; humans have had a long time to adapt to this diet.

But taking a different form of CLA created by an industrial process from a different source, that's not something I'd do.",Katsuo__Nuruodo,1747679473.0,,,,

37M, 6‚Äô0‚Äù, 200 lbs. I go to the gym about 3x/week and eat one main meal per day in the evening (sometimes a light lunch snack). I fast in the mornings, so I prefer all supplements to be taken once daily with dinner.

I have some mild memory issues (e.g. forgetting names or places), so I‚Äôm looking for a simple daily stack to support memory + overall health. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve come up with:

Once-daily stack (taken with dinner):

- MagMind (Magnesium L-Threonate) ‚Äì 2 caps (~1,000 mg)

- Multivitamin (Men‚Äôs Formula) ‚Äì e.g. SmartyPants or equivalent

- Vitamin D3 ‚Äì 2,000 IU

- Omega-3 (EPA + DHA) ‚Äì 1,000 mg combined

- Creatine Monohydrate ‚Äì 5g

- (Optional) Protein shake

- Improve memory/focus

- Cover basic nutrient gaps (due to 1-meal-a-day)

- Support gym recovery & brain function

submission,1kpwy9u,,0,"ChatGPT's (4o) Recommendation for Daily Stack, thoughts?",0.5,,"Rather than asking the community for what I should add to my daily stack, I thought I would go to ChatGPT first. Here is the prompt I fed it,

>Base your answer on information available on the subreddit r/supplements.

>Right now, I have hypothyroidism, so I'm taking 75 mcg of Unithroid to bring my T4 levels into a normal range. Additionally, I take 5 grams of creatine, and 7,5000 IU of D3, also referred to as Vitamin D or D-3, and 180 mcg of MK-7.

>Additionally, I'm a 34-year-old male with an active lifestyle, living in Texas, where we get plenty of sun. I take the D3 because I am normally deficient, given I'm a relatively pale red-head. I do strength training, in the form of rock climbing, and cardio in the form of cycling. Assume most of my bloodwork comes back normal now that I have normalized my T4 levels with the Unithroid. I also eat a healthy diet, minimal processed foods, and red meat. I try to eat some form of seafood at least every other week. I have no allergies. As I'm getting older, I'm looking to preserve my joints as best as possible, prevent injury elsewhere, and keep my mind sharp.

>Based on all of the information I have provided, what other supplements would you recommend I take? Can you also explain to me why they might benefit me in the short term and long term? Rank them based on importance, with optional supplements being at the bottom of the list. Thank you.

Here was its response:

---

Based on the type of discussions and evidence-based preferences on r/supplements, here's a ranked list of supplements that may complement your current regimen and goals‚Äîespecially for joint health, cognitive maintenance, and long-term well-being‚Äîwhile also accounting for your thyroid condition, age, and active lifestyle.

# ü•á Tier 1: High Priority (Strong Evidence + Relevant to Your Goals)

1. **Magnesium (Glycinate or Threonate)**
   * **Why**: Magnesium is frequently discussed on r/supplements for its role in muscle function, sleep quality, mood, and bone health. Magnesium glycinate is gentle on the stomach and supports relaxation, while magnesium threonate may have added brain benefits.
   * **Dose**: 200‚Äì400 mg daily
   * **Short-term**: Improves sleep, helps with recovery, reduces cramping
   * **Long-term**: Supports brain health, metabolic function, and may help with thyroid hormone conversion
2. **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA, ideally from fish oil or algae)**
   * **Why**: Even if you eat seafood every other week, you may not hit optimal EPA/DHA intake. These fatty acids are highly anti-inflammatory, support joint lubrication, and improve cardiovascular and cognitive health.
   * **Dose**: 1000‚Äì2000 mg combined EPA/DHA per day
   * **Short-term**: Joint comfort, reduced inflammation, improved mood
   * **Long-term**: Brain preservation, cardiovascular support, longevity
3. **Collagen (Type I & III, possibly with Vitamin C)**
   * **Why**: On r/supplements, collagen (especially hydrolyzed peptides) is popular among athletes for joint and tendon support. Some research supports reduced injury and faster healing.
   * **Dose**: 10‚Äì15 g daily
   * **Short-term**: Joint support, potential improvement in skin elasticity
   * **Long-term**: May slow joint degeneration, tendon and ligament support

# ü•à Tier 2: Medium Priority (May Help Depending on Individual Variation)

1. **Zinc (Monomethionine or Picolinate)**
   * **Why**: Zinc is crucial for thyroid hormone metabolism and immune support. Deficiencies are more common in people with hypothyroidism.
   * **Dose**: 15‚Äì30 mg every other day with food (to avoid copper imbalance)
   * **Short-term**: Immune support
   * **Long-term**: Thyroid health, testosterone balance, antioxidant defense
2. **Ashwagandha (KSM-66 or Sensoril extract)**
   * **Why**: Frequently discussed as a stress adaptogen, it may support thyroid function (T3/T4 conversion), reduce cortisol, and improve recovery.
   * **Dose**: 300‚Äì600 mg/day
   * **Short-term**: Stress resilience, better sleep, energy
   * **Long-term**: HPA-axis regulation, possibly supports thyroid function and cognition

# ü•â Tier 3: Optional Add-Ons (Niche Use, Mild Effects, or Less Evidence)

1. **Turmeric/Curcumin (with BioPerine for absorption)**
   * **Why**: Anti-inflammatory, may help joint pain and long-term brain health. Some mixed evidence, but often taken by those doing strenuous activity.
   * **Dose**: 500‚Äì1000 mg/day with fat and black pepper
   * **Optional**: For inflammation and joint longevity
2. **Lion‚Äôs Mane Mushroom (Hericium erinaceus)**
   * **Why**: Popular in r/Nootropics and occasionally r/supplements for neurogenesis and cognition. Limited human studies but promising.
   * **Dose**: 500‚Äì1000 mg extract (fruiting body) 1‚Äì2x/day
   * **Optional**: For long-term cognitive support and memory
3. **Glucosamine + Chondroitin or MSM**
   * **Why**: Older joint health supplements. Mixed data, but some users swear by them for climbing-related wear and tear.
   * **Optional**: Only if you feel joint degradation or want additional insurance

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Already Covered

* **Vitamin D3 (7500 IU)**: Likely sufficient, but periodic blood testing is encouraged to ensure you‚Äôre not overshooting (>100 ng/mL can be harmful).
* **MK-7 (180 mcg)**: Smart inclusion with high-dose D3, helps regulate calcium.
* **Creatine (5g)**: Excellent for strength, recovery, and cognition.

# Final Notes:

* **Labs**: Consider checking magnesium, zinc, and omega-3 status (or at least a 25(OH)D test for Vitamin D).
* **Timing**: Magnesium before bed, omega-3 with meals, ashwagandha in the morning or evening (depending on how it affects your energy).
* **Brands**: Look for third-party tested brands like Thorne, Jarrow, NOW, Pure Encapsulations, or Doctor‚Äôs Best (frequently recommended on r/supplements).

---

Thoughts? Seems pretty straightforward.

I had it recommend a dosing schedule, but I still need to know which brands to purchase. Any specific recommendations for:

1. **Magnesium (Glycinate or Threonate)**
2. **Omega-3**
3. **Collagen (Type I & III, possibly with Vitamin C)**

submission,1kpvpbb,,13,"Vitamin D, Magnesium, and K2",0.93,,"I took a blood test a year ago and it was determined that I had a vitamin D deficiency. All other levels on the blood test were normal. 

My physician prescribed a D3 supplement of I believe 4000 IU. I was supposed to take it twice daily, but experienced diarrhea so I reduced it to once every day, then to every other day until I just stopped bothering to take it at all. 

Present day, I decided to try taking vitamin D again to help with mood. Im taking one capsule of D3 (2500 IU) daily. 

A week after taking it, I began feeling extremely tired and my eye started twitching a bit. I read online that taking vitamin D along with magnesium and K2 can help alleviate some of those issues. 

I purchased 120mcg of K2 and 500mg of magnesium. After taking D3, K2, and magnesium, I‚Äôm starting to feel a difference in my energy levels and my sleep is more relaxed (could be placebo). The tiredness and eye twitching as stopped as well. However I am now experiencing diarrhea once again. I am not sure if it‚Äôs the magnesium, the K2, the D3, or the combination of all of them. 

There is a possibility that the diarrhea could just be a coincidence. I‚Äôm posting this for feedback on what to do or any recommendations while I continue to monitor my symptoms.

A few days after the blood test, my physician called me and said they wanted to discuss my results. They told me prior that they wouldn‚Äôt contact me if everything was normal so I was a bit worried. 

My physician told me I was vitamin D deficient but all other levels were normal. They described the symptoms that came with vitamin D deficiency but I didn‚Äôt find it too concerning at the time. 

They prescribed me the capsules and told me how to take it. I tried it for a couple of weeks but after experiencing diarrhea, I took a smaller dosage until I just completely stopped. The diarrhea I had experienced stopped occurring when I stopped taking the vitamin D supplement. I assumed the supplement I was taking was linked to the diarrhea, so I decided the supplements weren‚Äôt worth the hassle, so I stopped taking the prescribed supplement altogether. 

So I only took the prescribed supplement for a couple of weeks in 2023 and haven‚Äôt continued until recently (2025)

Now in 2025, I‚Äôve been feeling low energy. I randomly remembered that I had a deficiency in vitamin D, so I decided to try to correct it, hoping I‚Äôd feel better.

comment,mt0ts15,1kptm76,1,,,0,"If your goal is soluble fiber increase, there's better choices. If your goal is a prebiotic that increases SCFA production then I would go for chicory inulin first, then Jerusalem artichoke inulin second. The latter will give you slightly less gas than the former. 

I use a powder myself and opt for 5-10 g a day spread through the day. I first began using it at 1 g a day. First week will be a flatulence party in your gut and possibly give the Hindenburg explosion a run for its money, but you'll adjust fairly fast. 

Chicory inulin does a little more than Jerusalem artichoke inulin, and as the prices are roughly the same, the choice is more simple to opt for chicory. 

Speaking for myself, it took around 8-10 weeks for a noticeable difference. Some people notice changes within 2-3 weeks. Your gut health has a profound effect on the rest of you. It's always best to nourish it.",OhFuckNoNoNoMyCaat,1747604739.0,,,,

comment,mt14zo5,1kptm76,1,,,2,"While it's rare it does happen. I personally don't use OTC probiotics myself and opt for food sources. Inulin or similar FOS will help feed bacteria. Barring any other serious medical issue with you, you will see a turnaround over time. For probiotics, I would stick with stuff like kombucha, sauerkraut, yogurt and yogurt based drink (no sugar), miso (for dressings). Few scenarios call for them, and even then I would still recommend whole foods. 

 No change will come soon enough. It all takes time. For the next few weeks to 12 weeks, try to limit or eliminate your alcohol consumption, **added** sugar consumption, avoid excessive fatty meals. Avoid overly processing food. Avoid or limit overly processed foods. Focus on fruits, vegetables, yogurt, etc. If your conditions worsen, see a doctor.


But to answer your original question, the only chicory inulin in a capsule I have seen has been Nutricost. I believe Jarrow also makes one. Nutricost is affordable and seems to have a very good reputation here. I believe their serving size amounts to 625 mg, or just over over half a gram. This may be more convenient for you before you dabble in a powder. You can begin taking their suggested serving daily and then go up from there. I would take it with a meal. I personally take mine with coffee or tea or water through the day.

submission,1kpsiro,,1,Anyone here who knows a thing or two about propolis? I need your informed opinion on raw propolis vs. propolis extract,1.0,,"Very often when one buys a supplement standardized for a given ingredient, the name of the supplement differs from that of the ingredient, because the latter is only one component of the former. For example, you can buy magnolia root, standardized for honokiol 80-90%. 


But in the case of propolis, they just state on the bottle that it is ""concentrated"" propolis standardized to a 10:1 ratio, such that 500mg of the extract = 5,000mg of raw propolis. But the extract doesn't have any other name: it is still propolis. What's worse, is that raw propolis has a very distinctive smell, and that smell is almost completely gone in the standardized ""concentrated"" versions. 

So, I do not know what to make of this: on one hand, I do not want to ingest useless stuff that isn't biochemically relevant. This would incline me toward buying standardized propolis. But on the other hand, propolis is often discussed as a complex synergy of multiple components that work together to achieve its beneficial effects. Wouldn't standardization destroy that synergy, by inadvertendly throwing away useful ingredients deemed as ""garbage""? This question, together with the fact that standardized propolis doesn't have the intense smell of raw propolis, incline me to buy raw, non-standardized propolis.

You can also get a lot of help from an AIs like Deepseek when it comes to metabolism research. OK so there are a lot of things that are altered aftering a drinking binge, one possible useful for some outcome is metabolizing the drink leads to a lot of acetate. That can be a good thing if you were low on acetate. Acetate is needed for mitochondria to intake free fatty acids and you must be able to do that to be healthy.  Otherwise you'll have issues any time it's been a little while since you consumed a carb and the brain cells will also not work properly, you can't make ketones without acetate either.  You can try ALCAR as it has acetate on it, and also the carnitine part shuttles in free fatty acids, ALCAR is a double boon for processing free fatty acids.

Nope. :)


Studies indicate there is absolutely no need to cycle creatine.


Dunno what you're trying to accomplish, but there are quite a few supplements that (while not their original purpose), have been discovered to positively impact one's serotonin:


Inositol, creatine, and berberine are included in that mix.


Obvsly not a supplement, but there's growing evidence that a ketogenic diet can ameliorate - or at least attenuate - all sorts of psychiatric/psychological brain-based issues such as anxiety, bipolar disorder, and depression.

submission,1kpgycx,,1,Seeking supplement recommendations for morning and afternoon anxiety/stress/nervousness (26M),0.6,,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm a 26-year-old guy dealing with anxiety, stress, and nervousness that hit me at specific times of the day, and I could use some advice. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm experiencing:

‚Ä¢  Morning (1 hour after waking): It often starts during breakfast. I suddenly start breathing faster, lose my appetite, and feel anxious. It gets worse when I put on my shoes and jacket to head out.

‚Ä¢  Midday: The symptoms usually fade for a few hours after I leave the house.

‚Ä¢  Afternoon (3-5 PM): The anxiety creeps back, especially in my school or work environment. It hits again if I‚Äôm hanging out with classmates afterward, like grabbing food or drinks. I lose my appetite, breathe faster, and feel that anxious knot in my chest.

I‚Äôve tried Ashwagandha, and I can confirm it helps a bit, which is great. But I‚Äôm curious about other supplements that might reduce my anxiety, stress, or nervousness. They don‚Äôt need to be miracle cures, even small benefits are worth trying. If you‚Äôve had success with any supplements (or even lifestyle tweaks that pair well with them), I‚Äôd love to hear about it. Please share your experiences, dosages, or any tips!

Thanks so much in advance!",fountainpenfreak,1747564496.0,3,Recommendations ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kpgycx/seeking_supplement_recommendations_for_morning/

 It‚Äôs one of those things where our body chemistry plays a bigger role than we realize and makes sense why results vary so much between us.

\- Ashwaghanda (however it's spelled). Put me in a poor mood. Fortunately recovered after stopping.  
\- Lion's Mane. I believe this stuff is extremely toxic after my experience. Read the Lion's Mane recovery forum on reddit for more info. I'm one of the lucky ones, I guess.  
\- TMG. Unfortunately on this one. I felt great but developed hives after a few days. Really too bad. Although I have been able to take DMG to lesser effect as a substitute. Maybe I will try another source of TMG (I did buy Life Extension though so it ought be good, you would think).  
\- Vitamin E. I only would take tocotrienols (NOT tocopherols) and frankly they're just too expensive compared to other antioxidants like astaxanthin which seems more potent and noticeable.  
\- Fish Oil / Omega 3 supplements. All this stuff is rancid and I get plenty in my diet.

Many other things I've simply let the bottle run out and not reordered just because I try to set a (pretty high) limit on how many supplements I'm taking at any given time. And over time some become ""staples"" and others become not really necessary.

comment,mt7pyze,1kpfais,1,,,7,"why magnesium glycinate specifically can cause such paradoxical and severe side effects like agitation, anxiety, sleep problems (""going insane"" feeling), even though magnesium itself is generally calming.

Glycine's Dual Role in the Brain:

Inhibitory Neurotransmitter: In the spinal cord and brainstem, glycine acts as a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter by binding to glycine receptors (GlyRs). This action is calming and relaxing. This is the effect often highlighted when promoting magnesium glycinate for relaxation.

Excitatory Co-agonist at NMDA Receptors: This is the crucial part. In the rest of the brain, glycine (or D-serine) is an obligatory co-agonist at NMDA receptors. This means that for the NMDA receptor to be activated by glutamate (the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter), glycine must also be bound to its specific site on the receptor.

Think of it like a two-key system to start an engine: Glutamate is one key, and glycine (or D-serine) is the second key. Both must be in place and turned for the engine (NMDA receptor) to start.

How Extra Glycine Can Cause Problems (The Paradoxical Effect):

Over-Activating NMDA Receptors: If an individual's brain already has sufficient or even high levels of glutamate activity, or if their NMDA receptors are particularly sensitive, or if they don't metabolize/clear glycine efficiently, then supplementing with magnesium glycinate introduces a significant extra load of glycine.

This extra glycine can ""prime"" or over-saturate the glycine binding sites on NMDA receptors. When glutamate is then released (which happens constantly), it finds many more NMDA receptors ready to be fully activated because the ""glycine key"" is already abundantly available.

Result: Increased NMDA Receptor Firing: This leads to increased neuronal excitation, which can manifest as:

Anxiety and Agitation: The ""fight or flight"" system can become overactive.

Racing Thoughts: Difficulty quieting the mind.

Sleep : The brain is too ""wired"" to shut down.

Feeling ""Insane"" or Overwhelmed: Intense mental distress due to excessive neuronal firing and sensory overload.

Worsened Depression: While seemingly counterintuitive, some forms of depression are linked to glutamate dysregulation, and further excitotoxicity can exacerbate symptoms.

Why Doesn't Magnesium's NMDA Blocking Effect Prevent This?

Magnesium does block the NMDA receptor channel in a voltage-dependent manner. However, if the ""drive"" from glutamate + abundant glycine is strong enough, it can overcome magnesium's block more frequently or intensely.

It's a balance. The extra glycine might tip the balance towards more frequent or robust NMDA activation, even with magnesium present. The sheer availability of the ""glycine key"" means more NMDA receptors are ""ready to go"" as soon as glutamate arrives and the neuron depolarizes sufficiently to dislodge the magnesium.

Individual Variability:

Not everyone reacts this way. Many people find magnesium glycinate very calming.

Individuals who experience these severe side effects likely have underlying differences in:

Glutamate/GABA balance.

NMDA receptor density or sensitivity.

Glycine metabolism or transport.

Genetic factors (e.g., MTHFR, COMT, genes related to glutamate or glycine receptors/transporters).

Magnesium Glycinate Sensitivity & Processed Meat Link:

The adverse reaction to magnesium glycinate is likely due to the high dose of glycine, which can overstimulate NMDA receptors in sensitive individuals, leading to anxiety, agitation, etc.

Processed meats (like sausages, salami) naturally contain glycine as it's an amino acid found in all meats.

However, the amount of glycine in a typical serving of processed meat is generally much lower than in a magnesium glycinate supplement.

Therefore, it's unlikely that someone sensitive to the high glycine dose in the supplement would experience the same acute, severe reaction from normally consumed processed meats solely due to their glycine content. The primary concern with the supplement is the concentrated, high dosage.

The main health concerns with processed meats usually stem from other components like nitrites/nitrates, high sodium, saturated fats, and Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs), not typically their natural glycine content in isolation causing acute paradoxical reactions seen with high-dose glycine supplements.

Long-Term Effects of Processed Meats on Brain Health:

Regular and high consumption of processed meats is linked to several long-term brain health risks:

Brain Atrophy (Shrinkage) and Increased Dementia Risk:

Nitrites/Nitrates & Nitrosamines: Preservatives that can form nitrosamines (potential carcinogens), increasing oxidative stress and inflammation detrimental to brain cells.

Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs): Formed during high-heat processing/cooking, they promote oxidative stress and inflammation, implicated in Alzheimer's disease.

High Saturated Fat & Cholesterol: Can impair cerebrovascular health and increase inflammation.

High Sodium: Can lead to hypertension, damaging brain blood vessels and increasing vascular dementia risk.

Negative Impact on Learning and Neuroplasticity:

Inflammation: Chronic low-grade inflammation linked to processed meat consumption can reduce levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), crucial for neuroplasticity.

Oxidative Stress: Damages brain cells and can impair synaptic function.

Gut-Brain Axis Disruption: Processed meat-heavy diets can negatively alter gut microbiota, which in turn can increase inflammation and affect neurotransmitter production, impacting brain function.

Recommendations for an Individual with Magnesium Glycinate Sensitivity:

Regarding Magnesium Supplementation: Consider trying a different form of magnesium (e.g., malate, orotate, taurate) at a low dose and under professional guidance, as the issue might be specific to glycine rather than magnesium itself.

Regarding Processed Meats:

Limit for General Health: It's advisable for everyone to limit processed meat consumption for overall health, and particularly for brain health, due to the long-term risks mentioned above.

Healthier Alternatives: Focus on unprocessed fresh meats (in moderation for red meat), poultry, fish, and plant-based proteins.

Holistic Diet: Emphasize a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats (e.g., Mediterranean diet) for optimal brain health, rather than just avoiding one food group.

In essence, while direct acute reactions to processed meats from glycine are less likely to mirror the severity of reactions to high-dose glycinate supplements, limiting processed meats is a sound strategy for long-term brain health due to other well-documented risks.


Don't underestimate the risks of processed meat. I have read articles in the past that say it can cause permanent changes in the brain in the long run. Diet plays a big role not only for people dealing with mental problem, but for anyone who wants to live a happy and balanced life.

Running, for example, can have up to 80% of the effect of an antidepressant.

The idea being that our energy metabolism has been dialed down from the influence of Fructose (including body-made Fructose).  And Luteolin has been found to inhibit Fructose metabolism.

So this gradually restores your ""metabolism"" allowing your cells to better use fuel to produce energy.  This affects your diet (because cravings vanish once the energy deficit is gone), and also improves your ability to use stored fuel.

Zeolite is simply an earth clay. There is no mechanism by which it would help your child speak. As an autistic person myself, you should understand that there are lots of different sources and spokespeople for many different supplements that claim to cure facets of autism. 100% of them are snake oil and they are all grifters. 

Autism is most certainly an affliction of great consequence and it causes great distress especially in parents seeing their child suffer, and people love to capitalize on this because it's an appeal to emotion. I feel your great pain but don't search for answers in supplements. Give your child a good home, feed them a good diet, and love them as much as you can. You can also seek out some therapies that have been shown to be beneficial for people with autism if you wish. Random pills, substances, supplements and potions will not enable your child to speak or cure them of their autism.

submission,1kpafbw,,0,Whoever says saffron doesn't cause withdrawal symptoms is lying.,0.47,,"I thought I would try drinking some saffron tea daily for my depression and mood and I've been doing it everyday (1/16 teaspoon ground daily) for about 3 months and the last 2 days I didn't have any and I've been a little bit tired but most of all I've been having constant diarrhea. I mean I did eat some chickpeas last night but not enough to do this. Like every hour I'm having to run to the toilet and it's like I'm pissing from my ass. Absolutely disgusting. I've never had this much diarrhea in my life and my asshole is starting to get raw.

I have this Iranian saffron and I've been grinding it and taking a 16th of a teaspoon daily inside of some warm milk and raw honey. It works pretty good for depression but I don't know maybe I was just taking too much? 

Today was the first day in two days that I had some saffron. I came home from work, went diarrhea, and then I ate 1/16 of a teaspoon of saffron. I didn't even bother putting it in milk I just chased it with water. It's been about an hour now and I feel a lot better but still having that nasty diarrhea. Tomorrow I'm only going to have 1/32 of a teaspoon and taper down from there. 

Nowhere online does anyone state that they had withdrawals symptoms from saffron but chatGPT told me that I was taking quite a high dose and that diarrhea could be normal because saffron kind of upsets the digestive tract. Nowhere in my reading did I ever come across anything that stated anything about diarrhea. 

So yeah, those of you are thinking about taking saffron, think again. Hopefully this thread is useful for anyone thinking of taking saffron.

submission,1kp7j28,,2,chasing the wind(Ôºõ‰∏Ä_‰∏Ä),0.6,,"rant - I give up supplements. Well, to start with, we should ask ourselves: why do we take these things? It's certainly to have a better quality of life. But, these things, at least for me, seem to generate the complete opposite. Every time I try something new, it ends up causing some problem later on, the addition of something, many times, must be accompanied by other stacks of supplements. Research and more research, to understand the mechanisms and what to combine, to have the best synergy and effectiveness. And even then, however, sometimes the effort is not worth the result. The human body is incredibly complex and what works for one, may not work for another. Worry after worry, only boredom. I believe that some of you must have noticed, that things were better before - that your lives were easier, before we plunged into a pile of supplements, which increasingly pile up like a snowball. At least the snowball, at some point, falls off a cliff or collides with something.  It's just boring, we don't know if what we're using will continue to work until next week. If you want to be healthy, here's my advice: Omega 3 and vitamin D, a very low dose of magnesium and that's it. THAT'S ALL IT TAKES, no more chasing the wind. In fact, these things combined with a 12-hour or even 24-hour fast can do a lot more for us.",Round_Confidence1385,1747528384.0,6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kp7j28/chasing_the_wind‰∏Ä_‰∏Ä/

Omega oils are only worth if you get a quality extract, not dollar tree shite. If you can afford it, Superba krill oil is the creme of the crop. 

Vit D only worth if you don't get regular sun year round.

Magnesium is pretty good for athletes because you tend to deplete it during exercise. You should be taking electrolytes also.

Maybe try PQQ for mitochondrial efficiency.

Also highly consider juicing. If you struggle to eat fruit and veg, having it in liquid form helps quite a bit. It's easy to down a glass a few times a day.

The magnesium brand I like is Life Extension, but Thorne, Now Foods, Swanson, etc all do good versions. What's more important with magnesium is the form. Citrate is easier on the stomach, glycinate is commonly recommended for general supplementation and as a sleep aid and threonate is recommended as the cognitive boosting form.

Superba is an extract provider, they license to brands. Look on the back of bottles, it should say ""Superba"" on the ingredients even if the brand is something different on the bottle. Doctor's Best I know for a fact use it.

PQQ brands I honestly have no idea.

These are all pretty tame supplements, minimal downsides. Omega oils thin the blood slightly, but the effect is marginal. I believe PQQ can feel mildly overstimulating to some, and slightly increase free radical oxidation. Imo none of these are significant. I can't think of any ""must haves"" other than these.

Antioxidants like Curcumin and Astaxanthin will blunt exercise adaptation, which you don't want. Generally avoid heavy antioxidant supplementation.

If you really feel like your carb intake is extremely excessive, berberine (liposomal) might have a place in the stack. Beware: juicing is high-carb, but also high vitamins and more natural sugars than processed.",pushpullpin,1747520707.0,,,,

I already called my doctor about this and the nurse on call said I should be fine and to just ask during my next appointment, but I‚Äôm just looking for some reassurance from people who perhaps are more well versed in taking supplements etc. 

Before pregnancy, I started taking Nordic naturals pro omega 2000 with a combined DHA and EPA of 2,150 mg. I then got pregnant, and have still been taking this, as my prenatal doesn‚Äôt have any omegas or DHA. I am now 15 weeks pregnant and am worried I am taking too much of this supplement and that it could be harming my baby. I didn‚Äôt realize most people take 1,000 mg DHA and EPA combined during pregnancy. Does anyone have any experience taking comparable amount during pregnancy and they and the baby were fine? 

I know this is NOT medical advice and I should speak to and trust my doctor first and foremost, but I‚Äôm trying to get through the weekend without being too anxious if possible. Thank you.

My wife needed extra iron and calcium on top even though she'd been taking pre natal 9 months before getting pregnant. Iron supplements suck in normal to high doses.

There's also a herbal supplement with pretty good reviews called Rescue Remedy that was suggested to me, but I never got around to trying it.

But the absolute quickest thing is a breathing technique. People usually give up on them because they're difficult to train yourself to do during an anxiety attack, but the trick is to just push through and try, and sit with the technique, until it becomes a reflex. Your body will learn how to do the breathing technique while having an anxiety attack. 

The 2 I use are:  
\- Box breathing - Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, repeat.  
\- ""The Physiological Sigh"" - This was popularized by neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman and there is research to suggest it helps. The technique is a very deep initial breath until you feel a natural desire to stop, then a short forced inhale after that, and then an exhale that is longer than your inhale.

it's likely in my opinion you're all out of b vitamins folate and b12 is just the ones they tested, I'd recommend the b-complex from nutri advanced and then you could take some folate and biotin on the side

(you'll pee yellow but this is normal and drink enough with it!) this is the methylated form so you don't have to worry if you're body methylates correctly (people have been talking about this)

[https://www.nutriadvanced.co.uk/vitamin-b-complex-90-capsules.html](https://www.nutriadvanced.co.uk/vitamin-b-complex-90-capsules.html)

D3 you could either take twice a week 20'000 IU or everyday 6000 to increase your levels, take with K2 100 microgram, magnesium capsule and 3 mg of boron for correct absorption (this is important!)

Personally I'd recommend you ask your doctor next time you see him about calcium, if your D is terrible likely calcium is too

Your vit D is really dangerously low and can leave you susceptible to immunity risks, so you'll also want an infusion for that then 3 months on a 4 or 5,000 iui vit d3 mk2.
Some clinicians might reccomend 10,000 for 4 weeks and then dropping it back to 4/5k. 

Your B12 is fine but it might need to be at 600 if you've got methylation issues (sounds like you do) so sublinguil methylcobalamine is ideal, no folic acid.
(One a day) 

Your folate is low, so you you really would benefit testing mthfr, you might not have it, but you might have COMT or one of the other snps. Ideally a Methylated b complex like metagenics activated b complex but it really depends on all of your other minerals! 

Have you considered seeing a holistic practitioner?

Diet is super important, you will really want to make an effort if you're serious about addressing these issues. A wholefoods diet is always best where you're trying to get the most out of your nutrition, but you need to get some infusions first to get to baselines because basic supplementing could take 6 months to a year or more with your levels.

Iron Vit C either on an empty stomach in the morning or before sleeping!

Vit D and k2 together with boron and magnesium maybe after breakfast?

yes get a good b-complex and some folate and that you can take whenever as it's water soluble for example with the iron and Vit C

personally I wouldn't stress about combination and timing the most important thing for you is to start taking a useful dose to improve levels if you want you can send me links of the products you're looking to buy so I can check if the dose is efficient:))

  
yes high stress definitely can cause deficiencies especially minerals like magnesium and if you're iron and b vitamins are low you're more likely to feel stressed in a situation rather than feeling like it's fine as it's linked to the nervous system",nadjalita,1748067558.0,,,,

If it's only about birth defects risk the threshold is 0.5 mcg.

I know that many people like to say these thresholds are nonsense and one shouldn't be bothered by them, but there are many types of products on the market which show (when lab tests are publicly available) some brands can be below the threshold while others are not.

To my understanding Doctor's Best don't make their test results publicly available, even upon request by concerned costumers, but if they had to put that warning up on their Amazon listing it must mean they found one daily serving of 4 g/400 mg magnesium (at least it seems so, as the scoop and the nutritional table on the container is 2 grams but they recommended two servings a day) gets you past 15 mcg of lead by who knows how much.

There are many other brands without that warning, although who knows if internal tests are even required for any. But because the actual magnesium Doctor's Best use is made by an established American company (Balchem, the specific brand is Albion which is apparently Japanese?) I would've expected it to be ""cleaner"" if chemically possible. And again, why would only their unflavored powder have this warning?

I've also been buying their OptiMSM (which is too manufactured by Balchem) for a while and now noticed it has the same warning.",WhatsUpLabradog,1747508761.0,5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kp0mgf/how_come_theres_a_prop_65_warning_on_amazon_for/

Anyway, I don't know if what he says is actually true. If they only need to test a couple of samples from each batch (at the most extreme) in order to make sure they don't need to warn people about lead, it could very well be worth it to them.


One strange thing though is that Doctor's Best labeling on Amazon is a little messy. Most listings that do have it have it as a ""This product can expose you"" rather than ""*Consuming* this product can expose you"", which is the appropriate one regarding consumption of food or supplements. But I also found one or two that have the first warning under the specific ""Warning"" tab while on a different area of the listing they have the ""consuming"" warning.


So it seems the company isn't too diligent in what they're entering to their listings, including perhaps the fact that the unflavored and uncapsulated powder shouldn't logically have contaminants the flavored or capsualted forms don't have.",WhatsUpLabradog,1747570844.0,,,,

That translates to maybe 0.02 mcg lead per 105 mg magnesium serving (and still less than 0.1 mcg even if one takes ~400 mg a day as suggested on other packages).


A commenter said ConsumerLabs tested these and found 0.03 mcg per serving. So these are very low amounts, *but* Doctor's Best on Amazon don't feature a warning for this specific type anyway. So I still wonder if somehow only the powder has it worse.

Opened the package and there were 5 bottles instead of the 4 I had ordered. The fifth was something called ""Holy Basil Leaf."" (Capsules) I double checked the enclosed receipt and it did not list the this extra bottle.  I figured someone had enclosed it in my package by mistake.  I went to check out Holy Basil Leaf on my computer and when I found it was used to help regulate cortisol, among other benefits to the nervous system, I took a capsule and very shortly after I felt much less anxiety.  My anxiety response was not gone... was just not so extreme.  The feeling of impending terror I had been experiencing had quieted and I felt more ""normal.""  I did discover in the next few days that taking one in the morning was enough.  When I took a second capsule at bedtime it kept me awake all night.  My husband told me this morning that he feels much better mood and energy-wise since he also started taking it.  Just wanted to share this  experience with you all. I kept wondering if my guardian angel somehow had something to do with this stuff just showing up unexpectedly in my life.

EDIT: After several days the effects are so strong i'm going to cut back even more. It's nice not feeling terrifying anxiety but I need some motivation to be alive and do things.

I'm sad I have to report this but I think you all should know. I recentlly signed up after a long time away and for the first time I clicked on a link published in one of their reviews. It absolutely contradicted the review. Here's the link to what they said:

Here's what ConsumerLab said:

""	‚Ä¢ Similarly, the same dose of MK-7 did not show much benefit in a one-year study of 87¬†postmenopausal women (average age 64).¬†**Although vascular¬†stiffness did not worsen as much with MK-7 as with placebo based on one type of measurement¬†(Young's modulus), there were no improvements in¬†vascular stiffness index, pulse wave velocity, blood pressure, carotid artery wall thickness, carotid artery¬†diameter, or bone mineral density compared to¬†placebo**. There were also **no signiKcant improvements in any of these measures in a separate group of 78 pre- and¬†perimenopausal women (average¬†age 57) (de Vries, Nutrients 2025)**.‚Äù

Here's the link to the abstract they cite:

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40077685/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40077685/)

Here's what the abstract says:

""Results: The post hoc analyses showed a significant decrease in¬†desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP) plasma levels¬†after MK-7 supplementation (pre/peri,¬†p¬†= 0.009; post,¬†p¬†< 0.001).¬†**MK-7 treatment significantly¬†attenuated vascular stiffness¬†in post-menopausal women**¬†(placebo +49.1% ¬± 77.4; MK-7 +9.4% ¬± 67.1;¬†p¬†= 0.035).¬†**Post-menopausal women with a high stiffness index showed¬†significantly improved vascular markers after MK-7¬†treatment, e.g., a¬†decreased blood pressure**¬†at brachialis (-3.0% ¬± 9.0;¬†p¬†= 0.007)¬†**and an increased distensibility¬†coefficient**¬†(+13.3% ¬± 32.3;¬†p¬†= 0.040).¬†Conclusions:¬†Our results confirm that menopause affects vascular health¬†status**.**¬†**Post-menopausal women with an increased stiffness benefit most from MK-7¬†supplementation, with a¬†significantly improved blood pressure**. Further¬†research is needed to unravel the beneficial effects of MK-7 in¬†post-menopausal women.‚Äù

The conclusion of the full study says:

""This study supports previous findings and **adds insight about the contributing risk factors of CVD, e.g., a low extrahepatic vitamin K status.**""

one example is ""seed oils"", a lot of people avoid them and call them bad, but when you look at population studies, people who eat the most seed oils also live longer. but there's also studies saying they can harden the arteries. but both can be true, it can both harden the arteries and cause people to live longer.",rinkuhero,1747581272.0,,,,

Secondly, the statistically significant effect in blood pressure is for the low versus high stiffness groups. That's not the relevant statistic for someone who wants to lower their blood pressure: change versus a control group is.¬†


Thirdly, the significant change was only for diastolic pressure. Most people wanting to lower blood pressure for health reasons probably want to hit systolic blood pressure, too.


For these reasons and more, this study is a nothingburger for someone looking to supplement to lower blood pressure.¬†


At best it could inspire future work in the area, but on its own it doesn't say much. And even this interpretation is quite charitable.",MoralAbolitionist,1747547659.0,,,,

Most aren't going to be harmful assuming they are taken in their suggested dosage. If anything, a supplement just won't have any affect.

comment,msw65t1,1koz9jy,1,,,0,"Several things and several times over. Most especially starting out when I didn‚Äôt know how to properly cycle anything or what the mechanisms of action were.

No longer am I taking a b-vitamin complex based on what I‚Äôve read about them. I‚Äôve read that too high of folate/folic acid/folinic acid can cause issues with uptaking serotonin and dopamine too quickly. Not sure but there is stuff out there about it.

NMN and NR are harmful in undermethylators because it requires methylation which is already low in undermethylators. And there is skepticism about whether it‚Äôs effective. Check out Peter Attia‚Äôs podcast #46 with Chris Masterjohn.

Many things have disrupted my sleep. Have taken too late in the day: tyrosine, b vitamins, caffeine, rhodiola, coq10, quercetin and probably some others which are stimulating. Lessons learned.

Tongkat Ali - energizing and also sleep depriving.

GABA, Lemon Balm, passion flower, valerian root - good for a time but can cause rebound anxiety or sleep issues.

Melatonin - too much is counterproductive. Also can build up dependence.

NAC - anhydonia after a while

Vitamin D without K2 or probably enough magnesium. Don‚Äôt absorb as well and probably builds up more calcium in the blood.

Agmatine - insomnia too late and also rebound anxiety once it wears off

Ashwaghanda - didn‚Äôt know about the risks‚Ä¶took it endlessly even though it wasn‚Äôt working. Probably set me back.

Phosphatidyl Serine - good sometimes but can also cause paradoxical insomnia

Never tried it but Kava can harm the liver, apparently, if you are to believe some warnings anyway

Too much iron can be bad for organs and hard to rid.

5HTP or at John‚Äôs wart - serotonin syndrome if taking with things like SSRIs

Some things could have heavy metals or be contaminated.

If things aren‚Äôt taken in the right amounts, or if aminos aren‚Äôt balanced, could cause issues.

Could go on and on‚Ä¶so, yes, there are several ways in which if not supplementing correctly that it could backfire. Things have different interactions and so it requires studying and charting each one as it compares to what else you are taking. Understanding health on a macro scale is hard.

Too much or too little of a good thing, is a bad thing. The goal should be to achieve balance. If the body is perfectly balanced, you probably don‚Äôt need to supplement at all.

submission,1kowzee,,0,"New to supplement world and overwhelmed, with questions about cholesterol etc.",0.5,,"Hi!

I'm writing this because while of course I've always known about supplements I haven't really ever researched them for myself until now. I've been having some weird health stuff going on for the past 3 months and so I got some blood work done. Final results just came in and couple of things:

\- deficient in omegas (not a shocker because I'm vegan)

\- apparently I have high cholesterol which is highly embarrassing but I'm glad I know

\- Found out I have the MTHFR gene mutation 

\- while trying to figure out what was happening someone recommended taking B Vitamins because a friend started taking and she had similar symptoms to me but she said it helped a lot.

I guess I'm here two ask two questions:

1. Are there any general things that are helpful to know/ guidelines with supplements? I have seen things about taking too much of something which feels overwhelming because sometimes I look at two supplements I want to try but then they will both have one of the same thing in them (e.g they both have vitamin B-12 or something) and I worry about taking too much and overworking my kidneys etc. Also because of my gene mutation, I thought I should start taking l-methlyfolate after a little research, but after doing more research, several articles said actually taking that if not knowing the proper dose or how long to take it can cause over- methylation and be really dangerous. So it all just feels so overwhelming to try to know which are good, what's too much, what's safe etc.

2. I still don't really understand why my cholesterol levels are off since I'm a vert active 27F, don't smoke and only occasionally drink, and I'm no health food expert but I eat relatively healthy, so yeah I don't know. I'm trying to make even more health conscious decisions like increasing my activity and make more healthy food choices, but I was wondering what supplements people have had success with? I saw a list that recommended: Vitamin D, Berberine, PGX Fiber, Red Rice Yeast + CoQ10 and Plant sterols. Are those good or are there others?

  
Thanks for reading my long post lol and appreciate all help :)",nanitrim,1747499191.0,1,Recommendations ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kowzee/new_to_supplement_world_and_overwhelmed_with/

Symptoms came in as muscle weakness, Low mood, Tired, Sluggish mind, Lower then normal libido , constant fatigue and various other things which i just adapted to and thought it was normal. Results came in straight away, my libido sky rocketed.

Low vitamin D is linked to hormone imbalances, which in turn is linked to low testosterone in men, or low estrogen in women. It's also linked to thyroid issues. 

That's the short end of it. Vitamin D deficiencies are more common than you would think, even in the US. I'd say it's right up there with B12 deficiencies. 


With Vitamin D, there are a lot of what-ifs when it comes to natural body production and other medical reasons whether innate or caused by the person. 

And this is before the consideration that few foods have a high amount of it in them, and fortified food has very little. To emphasize, even with fortified foods or it occurring naturally in foods, the amount is too low to make a dent in a person who otherwise has a low serum level.

Last I read, nearly 47% of the US population is Vitamin D deficient.  That's horrendous once you consider the health issues that arise from it, and the likely misdiagnosis it may contribute to down the road. A cheap fix ignored causing major issues later.",OhFuckNoNoNoMyCaat,1747519277.0,,,,

Mine has been catered to my needs where my body responds exceptionally on top of a solid diet, which will matter more. I've done higher therapeutic doses when establishing my range and found it didn't move anything more other than drain my wallet faster. A good physician will work with you and not assign you an arbitrary number. I get lab work done regularly every 3 months. This is barely scraping the sand castle of health. There's a lot of factors that can possibly make omega 3 ingestion a moot point. 

To put it bluntly, it's not a magic bullet, and if your lifestyle and general diet are poor, it won't do much of anything. Unfortunately, when it comes to omega 3, the contradictory or rather how an individual responds isn't limited to the cholesterol magic it may possibly posses, but also how viable it is for something such as inflammation.

comment,msxi2z1,1kotv88,6,,,2,"‚ÄûThere is no such thing as an Omega-3 deficiency. Omega-3 itself is just a waste product, easy to promote as a health-beneficial supplement due to its overabundance, but often marketed without the necessary understanding of physiology‚Äîwhat it actually does, how it works, and what its effects really mean.

When you stress your muscles, arachidonic acid (AA) is the main prostaglandin precursor responsible for inducing muscle growth. Its pro-inflammatory properties are essential for triggering hypertrophy after stress, such as training. When a muscle doesn‚Äôt receive enough AA, it won‚Äôt grow much at all. And this, by the way, is how testosterone works: as a mobilizing hormone, testosterone increases AA levels in the body, creating a pro-inflammatory environment that allows the muscle to grow.

Logically, the more inflamed the tissue is, the more energy (ATP-Mg complex) and nutrients it requires to heal and come back stronger. An imbalance‚Äîspecifically excessive inflammation‚Äîwill do more harm than good. Therefore, it‚Äôs critical to tightly regulate the inflammatory state of the tissue.

This is where prostaglandins come into play. As explained, AA is required to inflame tissue, and other prostaglandins‚Äîsuch as DGLA-derived ones or those produced from the Omega-3 series‚Äîare considered anti-inflammatory. We need to understand that increasing Omega-3 intake reduces inflammation due to these properties, but as previously mentioned, we need a certain level of baseline inflammation to maintain healthy tissue and, even more so, to build better adaptive tissue.

A long time ago, in animal experiments, researchers stimulated metabolism, which resulted in dry skin. When the animals received Omega-3, the dry skin disappeared. Since then, it has been assumed‚Äîincorrectly‚Äîthat dry skin is a symptom of Omega-3 deficiency. However, in later experiments, physicians were able to eliminate the same skin issues using vitamin B6 supplementation. This suggests that the issue was not a lack of Omega-3, but rather a B6 deficiency. B6 is necessary to synthesize Omega-3-based prostaglandins. The deficiency occurred because the elevated metabolism (i.e., stress) increased the demand for B6.

This pathway has not been thoroughly studied, even though it‚Äôs relatively simple‚Äîlikely because the supplement industry got involved early on. Fish oil, being a waste product, was inexpensive and plentiful, and it was marketed based on the simplistic notion that ‚Äúanti-inflammation = health.‚Äù But as critical thinkers, we must strive to understand things at their core if we want real knowledge. It‚Äôs our duty as human beings to free the truth

Prostaglandins are synthesized along multiple fatty acid pathways: from linoleic acid (LA) to AA to DGLA, and similarly from Omega-3 precursors. All these conversions require specific enzymes, primarily from the desaturase family. These enzymes depend heavily on cofactors like zinc, vitamin B6, glucose availability, and magnesium. So when someone experiences so-called ‚ÄúOmega-3 deficiency symptoms‚Äù that improve after supplementing Omega-3, they should be cautious. It‚Äôs more likely they are deficient in zinc or B6, since the average diet provides more than enough Omega-3 to meet daily needs‚Äîespecially considering that the body tightly regulates these levels internally.

Taking Omega-3 supplements without truly understanding what they do can suppress inflammation in ways that seem beneficial at first glance. But because supplements often contain concentrated doses, people are likely to overconsume them‚Äîdisturbing the natural prostaglandin balance and, more importantly, masking deeper nutrient imbalances (like low zinc or B6).

For example, let‚Äôs say someone trains (like OP) and feels fatigue afterward‚Äîlikely due to high inflammation. If they then take Omega-3 and feel better, they may believe they ‚Äúrecovered,‚Äù but in reality, they may have just suppressed their regenerative processes. Adaptation depends on resolving inflammation, not just silencing it. If that individual was in a low-energy or nutrient-deficient state, true adaptation couldn‚Äôt occur anyway. A proper zinc and B6 status would help regulate inflammation more naturally, allowing recovery within a reasonable timeframe (48‚Äì72 hours).

Another common factor is poor hydration, which can contribute to POTS-like symptoms. If you don‚Äôt drink enough fluids with electrolytes, your blood volume may become insufficient to support inflamed tissue‚Äîespecially since prostaglandin E2 increases blood flow demand to affected areas. I‚Äôve seen many people take ibuprofen to lower inflammation, which may temporarily increase blood availability to the brain, because there isn‚Äôt enough for everything so to speak, but at the cost of blocking proper muscle growth and Adaption and concealing the real cause of their symptoms.

In conclusion, inflammation is not the enemy‚Äîit is a finely tuned signal system that drives repair and adaptation. Omega-3s may blunt this system when misused, concealing imbalances that should be addressed at their root: micronutrient status, energy availability, and recovery capacity. Instead of blindly suppressing inflammation, we must learn to understand and work with it. That‚Äôs the difference between superficial symptom management and true physiological intelligence.‚Äú",Shx92,1747561582.0,,,,

Guys, 99% of you don't need that. You are flushing money down the toilet and doing more harm than good for your body.

We get several posts here every week with people taking a multi (usually a bad idea) + 5 other supplements they all started more or less at the same time... And then they wonder why they get insomnia or other side effects.

Don't take vitamins if you have a access to a decent diet without getting a blood test first. Get tested for things like vitamin D. it's cheap (a lot cheaper than supplementing for nothing) and there is absolutely no way to figure out the right dose without getting tested. High dose vitamin D is dangerous for some and absolutely necessary for people with low levels. Just taking 1000IU randomly without having any idea if you need or not is pointless.
It won't fix a deficiency.

Multis do usually have something your body doesn't tolerate very well. Don't do it.

If you want to try something like ashwaghanda then do it right. Start low, without adding anything else within the next 6 weeks and monitor your results.

submission,1kononm,,0,Could supplements be causing my rash? And how long will it take to get better after I stop?,0.5,,"So I've been dealing with a rash thats been slowly spreading over the past week and a half. Looks kind of like folliculitis, with red dots and vesicles. Doesn't itch. It started on my neck and chest, and I assumed I was reacting to a sunscreen I put on because I put it on those areas and it was a product that I hadn't used before. But I only put it on my face neck and chest and now the rash has spread to my stomach, my arms and back, my groin, and there's even a few spots on the tops of my feet.

I did a video call with my doctor and she said it was unlikely to be the sunscreen and was probably something else in my environment. Ive been popping Claritin and it hasn't helped, but it occurred to me the other night that it could be that I'm overdoing one of my supplements. I'm curious what others think.

A few days before the reaction I'd switched my d3 vitamin. I was taking 10,000 IU every couple of days, and i started taking a 5000 IU d3/k2 daily from a different brand. I've also been taking a zinc/copper supplement, and last night I remembered that a couple years back I got a weird facial rash from cheap nipple jewelry; the steel plating had worn off and underneath it was brass (zinc/copper alloy!), which had fused to my skin. The rash presented differently, it was more like a bunch of tiny whiteheads covering my face, but clearly I'm sensitive to one of those metals. The other vitamin im thinking could do it might be b12? I was deficient when I got my levels checked in October so I've been taking 1000mcg but at this point it's been over 6 months of daily supplementation. So maybe I'm overdoing it at this point?

I decided to stop taking all my supplements, including the others i was taking and havent mentioned. My question is: the last day I took the d3/k2 and all my other pills was on Wednesday and the other 2 were taken on Thursday. If it is the supplements, when should things start to improve?",xXpaper_lungsXx,1747468530.0,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kononm/could_supplements_be_causing_my_rash_and_how_long/

As far as the libido goes, ¬†glycine can 100% negatively affect it, ¬† I‚Äôd try a different type of magnesium. ¬† ¬†Magnesium glycinate most definitely had a negative impact on libido for me, ¬†Malate or citrate both work fine without the libido issue, ¬†although citrate can have a laxative effect. ¬†¬†

comment,msr2g5c,1koc9sr,1,,,0,"Until last year, I was in the camp that zinc is a slam dunk supplement and most people would benefit from at least a modest dose. But after experiencing issues after supplementing zinc for a period of time on two separate occasions (I tried it twice just to be sure), I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs cause for concern with causing a mineral imbalance. Of course larger doses lead to problems faster, but even more modest doses like 15mg lead to issues after a few months of supplementation.

Maybe my diet is naturally borderline low in copper and my copper stores are just on the fringe, and a little zinc causes enough antagonism to send me over the threshold into copper deficiency, but I don‚Äôt do well on long term zinc supplementation. I am lucky as I am very in tune with my body so I caught it early and was able to reverse my issues in a month or so.

With that said and my N=1 data, I can‚Äôt recommend blanket zinc supplementation. I think it‚Äôs one of those that a blood test is a really good idea. You can get really sick with a zinc/copper imbalance. Sure plenty of folks take zinc no issue all day everyday, but I‚Äôd say the risk is significant enough that getting tested is just prudent.",OfferInteresting6088,1747460759.0,,,,

57M, active and generally healthy. I play a lot of tennis and care about recovery, joint health, energy, and long-term well-being. Also tapering off a long-term SSRI, so I‚Äôm paying attention to mood and focus.

Here‚Äôs my current daily supplement routine:

‚∏ª

Morning (with food):

	‚Ä¢	Creatine Monohydrate (5g) ‚Äì I do notice performance/recovery benefits

	‚Ä¢	Vitamin D3 + K2

	‚Ä¢	CoQ10

	‚Ä¢	Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)

	‚Ä¢	Curcumin Elite

	‚Ä¢	L-Theanine (200 mg) ‚Äì Sometimes twice a day


Empty stomach (AM):

	‚Ä¢	Mood probiotic (L. helveticus + B. longum strains)


Evening:

	‚Ä¢	Magnesium Complex ‚Äì good results for sleep and recovery 

	‚Ä¢	Zinc Picolinate ‚Äì 3‚Äì4x/week

	‚Ä¢	Melatonin (0.5 mg) ‚Äì Paused due to grogginess/puffiness

	‚Ä¢	Vitamin C (chewable) ‚Äì May cut this


‚∏ª

I actually feel:

	‚Ä¢	Creatine and magnesium

	‚Ä¢	Not much from the rest


‚∏ª

Thinking of adding:

	‚Ä¢	NAC ‚Äì recovery + mood support

	‚Ä¢	Collagen + C ‚Äì joints

	‚Ä¢	Ashwagandha ‚Äì energy/focus/stress

	‚Ä¢	Glucosamine/Chondroitin ‚Äì long-term joint health

	‚Ä¢	Selenium ‚Äì only if worth it


‚∏ª

Looking to trim the waste and focus on what actually works.

	‚Ä¢	What would you keep or drop?

	‚Ä¢	Any strong opinions on NAC vs collagen vs Ashwagandha?

	‚Ä¢	Anything I‚Äôm clearly missing?


Thanks in advance!

Check it out. There's some good YouTube videos and articles out there that explain why it works. It's just a sulferic mineral (methylsulfonylmethane) that a lot of us in north America (particularly Midwest) are deficient in because it's found in volcanic soil. You can't overdose on it.

I've been looking at selling a clinically dosed 38 ingredient AM & PM food suppliment and hammering away at Chat-GPT to be UK/EU compliant and all seems for naught, as a lot of the effective ingredients are either outright banned or classified as a novel food.

comment,msqls6s,1ko0dc5,1,,,2,"Well, a couple things. Your MTHFR status doesn‚Äôt really determine if you need methyl B. If you have a mutation, typically you‚Äôre better off avoiding folic acid, but some people do better with folinic acid than methyl B12. Often it depends more on your COMT status (people with COMT mutations sometimes can‚Äôt tolerate methylated vitamins).
Also, for being an overmethylator I think it‚Äôs more dependent on COMT status than MTHFR. COMT is responsible for clearing catecholamines as well as excess methyl donors. So if you have a mutation and are ‚Äúslow COMT‚Äù, you can be slow to clear methyl donors and therefore can become overmethylated.

Years ago before I knew my genetics I done that 20g loading phase. I was a walking ball of absolute anxiety. Sleep was non existent and I never once questioned the creatine.

A guy in my work place last year said his sleep was trashed. I asked him. Are you taking creatine? (He had recently started the gym that's why I asked). He said yes. Why?

Also, another thing I find interesting about creatine is that at least for me, I respond to it differently based how my hormones are that moment. For example, I have issues with having low estrogen with a normal testosterone level, and if I take creatine during that time, it magnifies the negative effects of low estrogen (poor libido, ED etc.) But, if my hormones are completely balanced and I take creatine, I feel amazing and everything improves.

I‚Äôm personally a bit skeptical of the idea that you can reverse aging. Once the body has aged, those changes, at least on a biological level, are kind of baked in. Sure, you might be able to improve certain things like energy levels, inflammation, or skin quality, but that‚Äôs not the same as turning back the clock.

Some things can be treated or reversed because they weren‚Äôt purely caused by aging (like nutrient deficiencies, oxidative stress, or lifestyle-related issues), but that‚Äôs different from undoing aging itself.

The one supplement I have noticed having a positive effect on anti-aging in terms of my joints and possibly a bit for my skin and hair and nails would be collagen. I noticed that 20g per day is a little more effective than 10 g so I take quite a bit of it.

My husband noticed a significant dip in testosterone and energy levels similar to what you were having in his early 40s.

* Live an active lifestyle, minimum 150 mins moderate and 75 mins high intensity exercise, do resistance training a couple of times a week.
* Eat plant based whole foods, fish, nuts, low fat dairy. Limit red meats alcohol, sugary drinks and highly processed foods.

comment,mte1hwo,1knywkv,2,,,0,"I have been doing the same protocol as they used in the GlyNAC studies for about 18 months (Glycine & NAC combined in equal large doses by weight, not volume as they have very different densities).¬†
In the most recent study on older people it raised glutathione levels and improved all the aging biomarkers in six weeks.¬†


Which is exactly what it did for me when I retested in two months: lower blood pressure, lower blood sugar, better liver values ... I don't know about my glutathione levels because my doc didn't include them in the test panels but it's an easy intervention so I am hooked!¬†


I used the exact amount of milligrams per kilogram of body weight they used in the trial -- there was actually a range though, and I chose to match the mg at the higher end of the scale.¬†


I am about 120 lbs so for me it's about 3 grams (3000mg) each of glycine & NAC powder.¬†
In the trial they split the dose into mornings and evenings but I have ADHD and that proved difficult so I take it all at once.¬†


The mg per kg of body weight formula is in the study protocols which can be found very easily on the NIH PubMed database if you search for GlyNAC.¬†


I weigh it out on a $7 scale from Amazon branded Fuzion (it is really accurate I bought a spare and then two more for friends) and stir it around. Then I dump it in a very big glass with three or four ounces of juice (I like cherry or grapefruit) which I dilute to the top with water.¬†


(It doesn't taste bad but it's tart like lemon juice so you can sweeten it if you like, I use monk fruit).¬† extract).¬†


So worth it. I have been taking NAC alone regularly for nearly 20 years and that stuff is great on its own but combined with Glycine it's a star!¬†


I don't know if it would work if you took ready¬†made NAC capsules at the same time you were taking ready made glycine capsules in equal milligrams -- maybe it would, but who knows whether it mixes as fully in the gut.


But even if it does, I would have to take five 600mg NAC capsules and siz 500mg glycine capsules per my daily dose and I'd rather swallow powders in juice flavored water than swallow 11 capsules.¬†


I'm sure lots of people weigh 240 or more and they'd be taking 22 or more capsules -- too many capsules, to my mind.¬†


Besides the powder form is cheaper.¬†


PS If you want a quick (temporary) fix to your stamina issues buy one of those two kilo bags of yerba mate off Amazon and brew it up strong the way they do in Paraguay and Uraguay -- it's not just the caffeine boost, mate is loaded with theophylline -- very good for energy and focus.",brasscup,1747786258.0,,,,

- Zone 2 (aerobic exercise) = best single modality for capacity and steady capability improvements.

- HIIT = fastest route to boost intrinsic mitochondrial function (capability).

- Resistance (anaerobic exercise) = builds muscle (thus capacity) and modestly enhances mitochondrial health.",Caring_Cactus,1747414129.0,,,,

I experienced a steady rise in my energy and focus after taking NMN for a few weeks. Adding Urolithin A helped with physical recuperation and stamina. In my experience, adding a couple of things (such NMN and Urolithin A) didn't feel like too much; they worked well together.

Nothing is a miracle cure unless you have surgery but supplementing should make sure your body has what it needs to regenerate and heal your skin.

You can also consume collagen supplements which have a lot of glycine in them too but that route is more expensive.  Give glycine like 3 weeks and you may well feel symptoms start to ease as cartilage starts to recover. Sometimes glycine can give extra energy during the day so first time, take it in the morning until you see if that happens.

Anti aging is just a marketing term. Common sense and logical thinking will tell you that nothing on the market will reverse aging.

What a lot of these supplements try to do is to slow down the aging process and optimise your body to repair some of the damage.

Like astaxanthin tries to encourage your body to repair DNA damage from sun. Collagen supplements encourage your body to build more collagen, as collagen production starts dropping towards your thirties.",jonoave,1747433460.0,,,,

That is not clearly true plus your statements are really more vague assumption vs science. Every cell in your body is constantly repairing and replacing components. For the most part, none of your cell parts are very old.  Research seems to suggest that most of aging is from accumulated damage in cells, especially in the mitochondria, that the body slowly gets bogged down in.  However the body does also have mechanisms to repair the damage or just start over with fresh construction.  There is a lot of evidence that enhancing those repair and replace mechanisms can improve health of existing cells which could easily meet the definiton of reversing aging, your cells can literally become more healthy than they were before and old damaged ones can be recycled for new healthier ones.  

Much enhancement can even be done usually normal natural behaviors like eating well, exercise, getting sun, and making sure every single nutrient need is met, missing even one can hamstring cellular health.  And that's before possible nutrient maxing science that is coming out lately.  We don't currently know how to make you a teen again but cellular health can be improved and it's not impossible that we could eventually learn enough to reach something close to being quite youthful again.",loonygecko,1747447722.0,,,,

For the average person there is a certain set of nutrients that slowly deplete over the years and repairing these deficiencies will improve your overall health. If you give your body the nutrients it needs it can do the job of repairing itself.

Be careful as sometimes oxidation from air will sneak back a bit of blue hours later though and you might need to repeat the electron donation.  MB both loves to take electrons but it also loves to give them back.   

Also people need to start slow with just one drop, too many people are taking a lot the first time and it's too much for them and they they think it's not right for them when really they just needed a lower dose.

That depends on what deaging means to you. If it means to reverse aging, ie going backwards then it's similar to how anti aging is being perceived by some people like OP. Which is biologically impossible right now.

>I mean obviously you have the same birthday still but physically your body CAN have the vitality of a younger you.

That's still just slowing down aging, not reverse aging. It's also just a comparison game. Being healthier and looking amazing at 50 compared to majority of the population, just means you're doing better than your peers. Doesn't mean you're aging backwards. You're still aging but possibly at a slower rate. That's still aging, and not ""anti-aging"" as OP seems to perceive.

I'm not against being healthy, in fact I do follow anti aging stuff and take some of them. I'm just under no illusion that these things will reverse aging, and hope that in the best case scenario they help to slow down aging or make it as smooth as possible.",jonoave,1747502053.0,,,,

That's not really how it works. Just because you can rebuild efficiently doesn't mean you're younger.

Yes cells are being replaced all the time. But that also happens to everyone, even older folks.

Ok let's say you bought car A and car B at the same time. Now you change the oil and service the Car A every 6 months, but Car B you do it every 3 months. 

After 10  years both cars have seen their wear and tear. But car B works and runs better than Car A. And compared to most other 10 year old cars. Like some cars that barely get their oil changed or carburettor fixed.

So is car B younger than 10 years? Did you deage car B?  

Personally I just think that means car B was well maintained that's why it still runs great. 

But no way did I reverse the age of car B. It still loses out to a brand new car or a regular 3 year old car. No well maintenance car can beat that.

But it might beat out a poorly maintained or regular 9 year old car. And if that's what deaging means to you, then more power to you.",jonoave,1747509302.0,,,,

comment,msvwp08,1knywkv,1,,,7,">Your analogy is not accurate because cells can replace EVERY part of the cell periodically

Wtf?

That's like the most surface basic level of biology, which is utterly incorrect. A new cell isn't a 100 percent new thing that is  100 identical and works 100 percent effectively just like the previous cell.

That's how aging and wrinkles develop. Collagen production goes down, your skin cells aren't being produced exactly like a teenagers skin cell. 

It's like making photocopy a picture, an inferior copy is made and the body tries to repair it or gets rid of it. Over time the body gets worse in doing this and more errors are allowed to pass. And the copies of each picture looks gradually worse than the original.


>It's like saying ok over the last 5 years, I replaced the frame, engine, fuel system, seats, control panels, windows, and one by one all the rest of the parts on my car, is it the same old car anymore when every part is replaced or is it now essentially a newer car?

That's a ship of Theseus, and an idiotic argument, if at all.

Humans are not freaking cars where you can swap body parts completely. 

And there's a genetic imprint or age.Cells grow and differentiate according to stimulus from the environment. Studies have shown that eg, putting a stem cell or a young cell in proximity with older, differentiated cells . Will cause the stem cells to adopt and differentiate into those older cells.

Anyway there's no point in responding further to someone with no understanding of biology. Or how simple analogies work.

Or believe humans are just like cars that can swap body parts. Which firstly, is completely infeasible and illegal.

And secondly, your idea is that injecting your body with the blood of babies constantly is totally deaging (whatever that means to you) and you'll reverse your age.

Edit: your username totally fits. A total loon who thinks humans body parts can be completely swapped like a car.",jonoave,1747531314.0,,,,

submission,1kntacy,,1,(Prediabetic) Is there a supplement/medication that regulates blood sugar/insulin without blunting muscle growth?,1.0,,"Hi all,

I am looking to gain a consensus here. I'm a 30 YO male with a slender frame (5'9 @ 165lbs) and want to bulk up/add muscle as much as possible. However, I have insulin resistance/pre-diabetes (A1C 5.8-6) and have been prediabetic my entire adult life despite being skinny. This seems to be a tricky task because while muscle is ideal for regulating blood sugar, any added fat will further compromise insulin function. My body virtually only stores fat in my stomach which makes it visceral fat, the worst kind.

I've read about how Berberine is potentially useful in helping regulate visceral fat and insulin but also it inhibits muscle growth. I'm interested in taking it while bulking but don't know how it will interact with muscle gain. Metformin seems to have a similar story but beyond those two I don't know of other supplements or medications.

Are there any supplements or medications out there that can help regulate blood sugar/insulin resistance without stalling muscle growth? I'm only pre-diabetic so even supps that aren't specifically designed for diabetics but have the desired effects i'm open to trying. Frankly I don't even care about reducing my A1C as i'm asymptomatic, I just need it to not go any farther. I'm tempted to just go nuclear and request insulin injections.

  
Thanks

My hypothesis is that KSM 66 isn‚Äôt bad in itself, it‚Äôs just way too powerful. I think this issues people experience is from large doses everyday crashing their cortisol and giving issues with GABA.

I think the key is to microdose.

submission,1knr39a,,2,Supplement Overload? Need Honest Feedback,1.0,,"Hey everyone,

So I‚Äôve been dealing with low iron since childhood ‚Äî I‚Äôm *extremely* pale, lips always cracked no matter how much I hydrate, and when I go for blood draws... legit nothing comes out. Nurses always say my veins are ""too shy"" and I look borderline anemic all the time. üòÖ

I‚Äôm now going on a calorie deficit to lose a bit of weight, but more importantly, I‚Äôm trying to rebuild my body‚Äôs strength from the inside out ‚Äî skin, hair, nails, hormones, digestion, energy, mental focus, immunity‚Ä¶ the whole refresh.

I made this supplement list to cover everything, but now I‚Äôm starting to wonder‚Ä¶ is this *too much*? Am I over-supplementing or causing more imbalance? Would love thoughts on synergy, redundancy, or what might be pointless.

Here‚Äôs my current stack plan (open to edits):

* Methylated Multivitamin
* Heme Iron Bisglycinate
* Methylated B-Complex
* Methylfolate (L-5-MTHF)
* Vitamin D3 + K2
* Vitamin C
* L-Tyrosine
* Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)
* Magnesium Bisglycinate
* Melatonin (0.5‚Äì3mg as needed)
* Saffron Extract
* Chromium Picolinate
* NAC
* Glutathione
* Iodine (from kelp)
* Selenium
* Zinc Picolinate
* DIM + Sulforaphane
* Turmeric + Black Pepper
* MSM
* Biotin
* Silica (Bamboo Extract)
* Collagen Peptides
* Hyaluronic Acid
* Astaxanthin
* Chlorophyll Drops
* Spearmint (tea or capsules)
* Probiotic (Women‚Äôs formula)
* Fiber Powder
* Milk Thistle
* Cardamom + Clove + Fennel Seed Mix
* Ceylon Cinnamon
* Dandelion Tea
* Fenugreek Capsules
* Mango Leaf Extract

Any thoughts from people who‚Äôve dealt with similar symptoms or supplement experts? üôè Especially if you‚Äôve battled chronic deficiencies and healed through stacking smartly.

Thanks in advance üíó",Old-Branch6215,1747365859.0,8,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1knr39a/supplement_overload_need_honest_feedback/

In my case, I alternate a few things daily. Some days, I take a multi and some days I just take a separate B complex, trace minerals, and a D+K.

I‚Äôd also suggest getting a full set of blood tests, including a full micronutrient panel‚Ä¶ including trailer levels if possible (see Vibrant Wellness as a good option).

submission,1knqkgw,,2,Looking for advice on ashwaganda,1.0,,"For context: I have ADHD, OCD and (possibly) Bipolar (but that one's not diagnosed). I've been on ADHD meds which have helped with focus (albeit not so much with dexterity issues). I recently started taking supplements daily because why not (about a month ago), and about a week ago I noticed I felt way different. 
I feel less craving or obsessive with regard to buying stuff or food‚ÄîI get some anhedonia that people talk about, and given my mood swings that does concern me, but I do like that I eat or buy things more intentionally, rather than buying stuff out of low impulse control and a craving for dopamine. I‚Äôm not totally protected from mood swings but I feel more resilient, more assertive and more confident as well as more goal-driven; on the whole I feel more ‚Äúmanly‚Äù, but in a mature way rather than something cartoony. 
I do still sometimes get the overthinking and ‚Äúanalysis paralysis‚Äù comes with OCD, which really can drive alot of bad decisions, but it does seem to happen less; the intrusive thoughts are much less common. As mentioned before, I still do get mood swings at time‚Äî(I found out coffee treats that way better than energy drinks, as a side note).

I suspect alot of these changes are driven by the ashwagandha (I take 600 mg of KSM-66, for reference). I‚Äôve noticed I feel groggy throughout much of the day‚Äîresearched and found out I should take it at night instead.

I wanted advice on how adding in l-theanine would help me or hinder me, and/or further advice with ashwagandha (‚Äúcycling it‚Äù as I‚Äôve heard people talk about)

For reference, I am taking:

* methylphenidate
* choline
* magnesium
* B12
* Biotin
* finasteride (propecia)",ChemicalCredit2317,1747364159.0,7,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1knqkgw/looking_for_advice_on_ashwaganda/

comment,mt9xnag,1knqkgw,1,,,2,"I think I was abusing it, similar to CBD, I would just take it maybe 4 or 5 times a day whenever I felt any anxiety. I now cope better with anxiety so I don't have to abuse ""supplements"" too much. I think traditionally ashwaganda is taken at night, that is what this girl from India told me. It may be good to do like 1 month on, 1 week off, if you are afraid you are becoming too dependent on it. You could in addition do like 1 day off a week so you are not taking it everyday. I think some supplements should be treated the same as drugs, in that you don't want to take them everyday or all the time because they can become less effective. I also don't generally take melatonin every night. The 1 month, 1 week off is common for herbal supplements. If you feel like it is not working for you or making you too lethargic you can always stop taking it. I think many people don't like ashwaganda because at one point they were adding it into every supplement and people got mad and reported that they felt like zombies, I think this is because they were probably abusing it. L theanine I think was worse for me because it just gave me a sedating effect without a mood boost or libido boost that ashwaganda can give.

I searched the entire web.

Every single 1000 mg potassium supplements are brands that originated in China. I am not sure how advertising law works for them to claim that? But based on China's reputation, I highly doubt these 1000 mg potassium pills are real, because high dose potassium needs to be formulated in a special slow release form to negate its GI symptoms. I highly doubt these Chinese companies are doing that in these 20 dollar a bottle gummies.

  
So I found this one company called Life enhancement. but on the website and the bottle, it stats that it has not been Evaluated by FDA etc.. 

  
Is there any US brand or any legit supplement company that sell these?     Almost every single US brand or grocery store brands has it maxed out at 99 mg potassium per capsule.

submission,1knmwkg,,29,Bad reaction to L-theanine - My experience,0.83,,"Hi everyone,

  
I know L-theanine is widely praised in this community ‚Äî and for good reason in many cases ‚Äî but I wanted to share my experience in case it resonates with anyone who may have had an unexpected or negative reaction like I did.

**Background:**  
24M, high-stress job.  
Back in November 2024, I started supplementing with GABA (750 mg daily in the evenings). It noticeably helped with evening relaxation, reduced mental chatter, and made it easier to sleep. I used it consistently for around 2 months without any negative side effects.

In January 2025, I decided to switch to L-theanine (200 mg/day, brand: Aliness), based on its reputation for promoting calmness and modulating glutamate without the questionable bioavailability concerns of GABA.

**However ‚Äî and this is where things went wrong:**  
After just a few days on L-theanine, I started experiencing sudden and unexplained **derealization, dissociation, anxiety, and emotional numbness/anhedonia**. It got a little better after that but still felt ""weird"". I didn‚Äôt connect it to L-theanine at first and kept taking it for nearly 2 months.

The reason I kept taking it ‚Äî even though something clearly felt off ‚Äî is because at the time, it actually *helped* me function at work in a weird way. It made me more emotionally blunt and detached which I thought was better than dealing with everyday stress. I could just ""autopilot"" my day without a care.

I had this strange sense that it was suppressing all my anxiety artificially, and that it was all going to come back eventually‚Ä¶ but I didn‚Äôt care. That numb detachment made it easier to handle my stressful job ‚Äî I just stopped reacting to anything.

But about two months in, something snapped.

**One day at work**, I suddenly started experiencing some terrifying symptoms. It felt like I had ‚Äúgreened out‚Äù on weed ‚Äî like I was *high*, but not in any pleasant sense. Everything around me felt alien.

  
I don‚Äôt even know if it was a panic attack, because of lack of tachycardia (or maybe I just didn't feel it at the time, not sure) or something else, but I became *severely* anxious and dissociated. 

I had to go hide away from people just to ride it out. It felt like existential distortion of the logic that flows into concepts of what's real. I felt a heavy dissolution of reality and all meaning and it's like I'm still rebuilding some details of my mental faculties if that makes any sense. 

My mind was looping ‚Äî like a fever dream. I was thinking it could be a serotonine syndrome but it honestly felt like ego death...

After that day, I immediately stopped taking L-theanine. The symptoms actually got *worse* for a while after quitting. I had a panic attack after drinking coffee - which I never had before (and which is why I stopped drinking coffee for 2¬Ω months.)

After a few days symptoms slooowly started to fade - only coming back in a stressful situations.

**One month later**, I started sertraline (e.g. Zooloft - named differently in my country, currently 75 mg) and trazodone (50 mg) under psychiatric guidance ‚Äî and almost immediately the same symptoms came back in full: anxiety, overstimulation, agitation, intrusive thoughts, tension. It felt like the same system that was disrupted by L-theanine got triggered again.

**My theory (based on a lot of reading and some guesswork):**

L-theanine isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúgreen tea calm in a capsule.‚Äù It modulates **glutamate** and **glutamine** levels in the brain ‚Äî potentially *increasing* glutamate uptake or acting differently in those with sensitive or already imbalanced systems.  
My suspicion is that after 2 months of GABA supplementation (possibly downregulating excitatory activity), the switch to L-theanine pushed my glutamatergic system into chaos.

Once that system was destabilized, I became hypersensitive ‚Äî even SSRIs (which also affect glutamate in addition to serotonin) seemed to re-trigger the same symptoms.

I understand this might sound unlikely to some, especially to those who‚Äôve had great results with L-theanine ‚Äî but I think it‚Äôs important we don‚Äôt assume that just because a supplement is ‚Äúgenerally safe,‚Äù it works the same for everyone.

**I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who‚Äôs had a similar experience with L-theanine, or who has any insight into glutamate/GABA imbalance triggered by supplements.** This has been a tough and confusing journey - I'm still trying to make sense of what happened, and I‚Äôd really appreciate any shared perspectives.

Thanks.

**TL;DR:**  
GABA helped for 2 months ‚Üí switched to L-theanine (200 mg) ‚Üí developed derealization, anxiety, dissociation.  
Kept taking it because it made me emotionally blunt and helped me function at work.  
After 2 months, had a scary breakdown at work ‚Äî extreme dissociation, loopy thinking, thought I had serotonin syndrome.  
Stopped L-theanine, symptoms worsened briefly, then lingered.  
A month later, SSRIs triggered the same symptoms again.",Heins_Baked_Beans,1747352668.0,26,Experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1knmwkg/bad_reaction_to_ltheanine_my_experience/

comment,mskrr0e,1knmwkg,5,,,0,"It wasn‚Äôt triggered by L-theanine for me, but reading your symptoms sounds exactly what I started experiencing about 4 years ago. In that time I‚Äôve experienced the random depersonalization and panic attacks. The best way I can describe it is existential paranoia and emotional numbness.

During that time I became unable to tolerate caffeine like I used to. Any small amount would trigger the symptoms. I switched to drinking kukicha green tea (low caffeine/high in L-Theanine) as a replacement for a while, but it always made me feel really emotionally numb.¬†

For the past year, the derealization and panic attacks have mostly calmed down, but I was left with the emotional numbness. After experimenting with various supplements and not ¬†noticing any improvement, I decided to stop all supplementation just to see what would happen. At that point I was only taking vitamin D 5,000 iu almost daily, so I stopped.

I‚Äôm about 4-5 months out now and have noticed a massive improvement in emotions coming back. I can also tolerate caffeine like I used to, without it triggering the derealization/panic attacks. I‚Äôm still not 100% back to where I used to be though in terms of mood, but feel it improving.

I‚Äôm still not sure why stopping vitamin D helped me or whether it‚Äôs relevant to your situation, but I hope it helps somehow. My advice would be to stop all supplementation and let your body balance itself out. I know it‚Äôs tempting to want to try to find the cure immediately, but if you give it space your body will balance itself out.",NemoUnder,1747372081.0,,,,

Very weird feeling.  Because it was a chewable, I cut down the portion to 1/4 and took that.  It didn't do the strange feeling.  I'm not sure if it was really calming either.

Fast forward a decade and I'm taking l-theanine again but in very small amounts like 25-50 mg with other stuff like lemon balm.  I think it's helping with sleep.

comment,msjhqys,1knmm4f,2,,,0,"One thing she should NOT take is glutamine. Also, there is a debate in oncology whether anti-oxidants are good or bad for cancer patients, given that the tumors can benefit from them just as well as our bodies. So I would stay away from the most powerful antioxidants: vitamins A, C, and E, N-acetyl-cysteine, alpha-lipoic acid, and astaxanthin. 

I am deliberately staying away from telling you what she should take. That's because many supplements have academic papers that claim anti-cancer effects, but the whole research in this area is choke full with impostors, charlatans, academic fraud, fabricated data, p-hacking (misuse of statistical methods) and the like. So you can't easily tell what is garbage, and what is the real thing. All I can tell you is an enumeration of some of the supplements that seem to have the most research showing an anti-cancer effect. For the reasons mentioned above, this does not mean that you should go and buy them. 

But here they are: artemisinin; graviola; luteolin (not lutein); EGcG; berberine; cimetidine; nattokinase; a number of mushrooms (reishi; turkey tail; chaga; shiitake; and maitake); resveratrol; quercetin; boswellia; plant sterols including betasitosterol; licorice root (but NOT Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice; you want the full-spectrum root); bitter melon; neem; ashwagandha; marjoram; apigenin; panthetine; chanca piedra = phyllanthus niruri; moringa; propolis; curcumin.",Duduli,1747353532.0,,,,

submission,1knjh70,,1,Possible reasons that vitamin D deficiency symptoms aren't improving during treatment?,0.67,,"Hi all, I am not looking for medical advice, rather just some possible ideas as to what could be the deal here.

 Recently I was diagnosed with a Vitamin D deficiency. My level was 7.2. I was prescribed the standard 50,000 IU weekly megadose. Well it is week 4 and I can honestly say that I have not felt any better at all since starting these. I have had muscle aches pretty much constantly still. I have still been very fatigued. My period symptoms have been significantly worse, and today I have had nonstop chills. 

It seems like things are only getting worse... I feel like there's gotta be something I'm doing wrong. Is there any logical explanation as to why I'm not improving? Should I look into taking other vitamins? Or is it just taking a while for the vitamin to kick in? Should I go and check to see if I am deficient in other areas?

comment,msje72m,1knjh70,4,,,0,"Vitamin D needs magnesium to activate it and ensure it's converted to its bioavailable form for use in the body.  Without it, and if you have a magnesium deficiency, it'll dramatically reduce your body's vitamin D absorption.

Similarly vitamin D requires vitamin K, specifically K2. K2 helps direct the calcium in your blood to your bones and teeth, as opposed to calcifying your arteries and other soft tissues.

Zinc - The Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene which is important for multiple vitamin D functions in the body, including at DNA level. Recently it's been found to be important for T cell function. Microbes slow down immune reactivity by dysregulating the VDR gene so that they can survive longer. The DNA binding domain of VDR requires Zinc for proper function. Without Zinc VDR can't properly bind to DNA, resulting in it being unable to exert its functions which include but are not limited to:

- Controlling the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestine into the bloodstream, which is essential for bone and teeth formation.
- Regulating genes responsible for cell growth/death.
- Immune response
- Hair growth
- Metabolism

It's also required to activate AHR, which is directly linked to the reduction/elimination of gut disorders such as IBD.

Copper - Zinc depletes your copper stores, and works hand in hand with Zinc.",Jammy-Doughnut,1747352263.0,,,,

comment,msjbo0k,1knjh70,2,,,0,"As per u/Full-Regard:

>Vitamin D is fat soluble and must be taken with a meal with ~10g of fat. You also need magnesium and boron to support absorption. Include K2 to direct calcium to bones. There‚Äôs also vitamin D receptor gene mutations that can affect how much vitamin D you need. And if you have those mutations, vitamin A and zinc can be important to help activate the vitamin D receptor.

comment,msjjun7,1knjh70,1,,,0,"It can take months of supplementation for your vitamin D level to go up and symptoms to resolve. 7.2 ng/ml is pretty low. It's likely your level has gone up a bit, but you haven't even finished your script.

Unfortunately, it sounds like your doctor put you on the 50K IU weekly D2 prescription. This is an old way of doing things.

D3 is what your body would made when you're in the sun. It is more effective as raising the blood level. D2 does not have the same or full vitamin D activity as far as the immune system is concerned.

Daily dosing will raise your serum level faster than equivalent weekly doses. So, even if they did give you D3, the script may not be your best option.

It would probably be better to switch to 5K IU D3 daily. Or you could do both and then continue the 5K to maintain.

If you experience new symptoms, then that is likely due to a lack of magnesium. Magnesium is not required to absorb vitamin D, but it is involved at several steps in vitamin D metabolism. Many people low on D are also low on magnesium. You can supplement it, but also eat magnesium rich foods.",VitaminDJesus,1747354313.0,,,,

What is really important is to identify the differential: are there chemicals/nutrients that are absolutely critical to the tumor, but that are not very important to the human body? And once you identified those, you can help fight cancer by minimizing the amount you ingest.

submission,1knf359,,130,Took 120 mg Zinc daily for the past 5 months - how fucked am I?,0.89,,"Title says it all. I've unfortunately misremembered the dosage of my Zinc supplements, and instead of it being 15 mg pr. pill, it was 15 mg. pr. 1/4 of the pill. Just discovered it today, and I'm quite worried.

I've been feeling quite off for the past few weeks, and I'm scared that this fuck-up has caused some permanent side effects, and I just need someone to calm my nerves.

I will speak to the doc as soon as I can, and maybe take some blood tests while I'm there to access the situation.

But what do I do now? I'll for sure take a break from zinc for a week or two, but how can I help myself get back to ""normal""?

EDIT: Hi y'all, thanks for all the responses. You've really helped to calm my nerves, and even though I'm quite an analytical person, sometimes the primal responses take over, and in order to remedy this overdosing, I was ready to jump from one extreme to another, but you've told me otherwise.

Just spoke with the doc, and she's going to make a treatment plan after the weekend - she also told me she'll read up on it during that time, apparently it's the first time she has ever seen a chronic zinc overdose case.

I've also not taken the zinc for around 30 hours now, and I feel much, much better already. My cognitive function is much better now, and I'm nearly not as tired as I was just a few days ago, even if I slept like complete shit tonight due to this stressful situation.

In the meantime she advised me to stop the zinc supplementation (what a surprise), and not to start on any copper supplementation until we can get some bloodwork done. A much more cautious approach than what I would've liked, but it's understandable.

Until then though, it looks like massive amounts of potatoes and beans are back on the menu!

EDIT 2: Popping in again just to say one important thing - if anyone reading this thread has ever thought about their sudden, weird cravings, consider the reason as to why they've appeared. Because I just realized that ever since starting on this massive dose, I've had really bad cravings for potatoes + potato chips. Maybe a coincidence, but since potatoes are rich in copper, then dunno, my body might've just been subconciously trying to tell me that something's wrong.

comment,mshmhq1,1knazof,2,,,0,"L-Theanine is ***psychoactive*** even tho its a supplement. 

Theanine is structurally similar to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, and binds to glutamate receptors in vitro, though with much lower affinity in comparison. Specifically, it binds to ionotropic glutamate receptors in the micromolar range, including the AMPA and kainate receptors and, to a lesser extent, the NMDA receptor. It acts as an antagonist of the former two sites, and a partial co-agonist of the NMDA receptors. In vitro, theanine also binds to group 1 mGluRs. In addition, it inhibits glutamine transporters and glutamate transporters, and thus blocks the reuptake of glutamine and glutamate.

Magnesium---Mostly for sleep but have a variety of benefits.

Benfotiamine--For Neuropathy

Vit D3---I generally test on low side of normal

Red Yeast Rice--for high cholesterol (I don't feel this one, but blood work is better when I take it)

Lithium--An absolute life changer.  I take for anxiety.

Iodine--when I first started supplementing it was ""profound"". Cleared brain fog, increased energy.  I don't notice the effects so much anymore but I faithfully take it but in microdosing.

Hyaluronic Acid--helps with joint pain and actually improves skin look/plumpness.

Zinc L Carnosine--for stomach issues  

I was experimenting with supps that are supposed to help with alertness, cognitive issues but everything I tried made feel off, anxious, wired or just plain bad--Lions mane, Bacopa, ALCAR, Taurine.--These are all on the ""reject shelf"".

You can experiment with various strains of lactobacillus too, if you're interested in some strains that may be beneficial based on studies. I'm using l reuteri, l gasseri and l shirota (last one is yakult). Results are delicious and it's one of those low time investment high health returns things you'll want to keep doing. One batch typically lasts me maybe three quarters of a week, but I eat alot.

Another is kefir, super easy, just pour milk onto the cultures and wait, then strain. Caveat is the first few batches will taste like trash. Just have to keep going and the end product is decent.

Kombucha is another delicious one but, I know if I get into this I'll end up making 5 gallons at a time after a while so I haven't gone down that rabbit hole. A good Kombucha is something special though, hard to find good ones where I am. 

I'm mildly lactose intolerant and, I don't kind any issues with these. The lacto fermentation breaks down lactose.

You're getting very high counts of a diverse array of microbes with those two. 

With things like kimchi etc you'd need to probably eat alot to get benefits. Sauerkraut.. Didn't like it as a kid but who knows maybe I will now. Can be hard to keep mould out of fermented solid foods in my experience.",Breathofdmt,1747830819.0,,,,

I've been doing a deep dive into cocoa products and trying to find the *sweet spot* between **high flavanol content**, **low cost**, and **minimal heavy metal contamination**.

Here's what I‚Äôve found so far:

**üß™ Independent Lab Flavanol Testing (per gram):**

* **CocoaVia (Cardio Health):** \~106.1 mg/g
* **Navitas Organic Cacao Powder:** \~25 mg/g
* **NOW Foods Organic Cocoa Powder:** \~19.6 mg/g

**üíµ Estimated Cost Per Gram of Flavanols:**  
*(based on product prices and flavanol content)*

* **CocoaVia:** \~$2.66/g
* **Navitas:** \~$2.27/g
* **FlavaNaturals:** \~$1.79/g
* **Wild Foods Cocoa Powder:** \~$0.52/g (no verified lab data yet)
* **NOW Foods:** \~$0.38/g (assuming 19.6 mg/g holds across servings)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Heavy Metal Concerns:**  
According to ConsumerLab and other third-party testing, many cocoa powders have elevated levels of **cadmium and lead**. CocoaVia seems to have lower contamination, possibly due to their specialized extraction process. This may partly explain the price.

**üß† My Ask:**  
Does anyone know of other **cocoa powders or flavanol supplements** with:

1. **High flavanol content** (ideally ‚â• 25 mg/g),
2. **Low cost per gram of flavanols**, and
3. **Verified low heavy metal levels**?

Bonus points if there's third-party testing or published data to back it up. Also open to **epicatechin supplements** or **cocoa bean extracts** if they fit the bill.

Thanks in advance!

I'm genuinely scared right now as I keep having vertigo effects, and slight laxative effects. Been taking these suppliments for the past week.

My suppliments are:
1 gel capsule of Omega 3 (250mg) + EPA (500 mg)
1 tablet Vitamin C (1000mg)
1 capsule Vitamin A (10,000 UI)
1 gel capsule Vitamin D3 (5000 UI)
2 capsule Magnesium Citrate (400mg)
1 capsule Magnesium Glycinate (125mg)
1 capaule Calcium (180mg)
1 capsule Zinc Picolinat (22mg)
2 capsule Ashwagandha (450mg)

Any advice or help is greatly appreciated.

EDIT: I really cannot thank you guys enough for the support and reassurance!! ‚ù£Ô∏è

Apologies that my post was admittedly hysteric and alarming. I am new to some of the vitamins I've listed and I didn't know these side effects would be this bad, so I was worried. I should've came here asking for advice before ignorantly pumping all these suppliments in me.

Your stack is way too heavy on vitamin A & magnesium, esp diving straight in without slowly introducing them, which can cause vertigo and laxative effects.

comment,msfllet,1kn5sm0,19,,,0,"Vertigo, if accompanied by nausea, shortly after taking them could be caused by the zinc irritating your stomach if taken without food on an empty stomach (use a cup of milk for instant relief). But most probably, it's the Vitamin A, which is on the upper limit and could cause vertigo even after a week, if not deficient. Also, you could be temporarily screwing your electrolyte balance and that could lead to inner ead fluid imbalance, also causing vertigo.

Otherwise, nothing else seems out of the ordinary, but the magnesium seems a bit high if not exercising daily.

The laxative effect comes from the Magnesium Citrate (mainly) and Vitamin C (more than 500mg does that to some people).

Magnesium Citrate can have laxative effects and Magnesium Glycinate can sometimes cause hyperactivity or nausea. There's nothing much to be afraid of as such though.

comment,msomciy,1kn5sm0,2,,,0,"It's going to be fine. You just introduced too much too soon and maybe need to dial back and re- introduce slowly and make sure you eat before taking vitamins. 

1. You can lose the mag citrate. It is probably causing the laxative effects.  The mag Glycinate should be enough and more bioavailable. You can take up to 800mg of Mag glycinate. 

2. Dial back on Vitamin A. You only need about 3000 IU or 900 Micrograms of retinol. Take retinol not beta carotene. Vitamin A is a safety concern as too much can damage your liver. 

3. Stop the Ashwaganda and only add it back after your symptoms go away in case Ashwaganda doesn't agree with you. 

When taking supplements google RDA and watch videos or read up on what kind of supplements to take and any possible side effects and bioavailability so you are taking the correct forms and amounts.

comment,msnbqmi,1kn5sm0,1,,,0,"The magnesium glycinate and the Magnesium Citrate that you're taking are most likely giving you an upset stomach. They're very hard to digest. If you want to be taking a magnesium look at magnesium by glycinate.
You're also taking a lot of different supplements all at the same time. That can be a little hard on your body. Some medications or supplements can lower your blood pressure. It's really important to do more research into what you're taking. Start out slowly and see which supplements agree with your body. Low blood pressure can also cause vertigo.
A lot of Health starts in the gut. Often it's best to start taking a probiotic. You can also get gas and a slightly upset stomach if your flora and fauna intestinal are out of whack.

comment,msomvls,1kn5sm0,1,,,0,"You may be getting vertigo from the high magnesium. It's not clear whether 3 capsules equals 400 mg or 2 capsules, both 400 mg. If you're taking 2 that are each 400 that's very high for a week and could cause of course diarrhea which messes up your other electrolytes which could cause vertigo or weakness etc. I want to add that in the lab there are both low and high critical levels on magnesium potassium and sodium because you could die if levels fall above or below. They affect your heart. You'd feel very bad first. The vitamin a is a little high but not alarming I've taken that dose before for short term i don't think thats causing your symptoms but i would drop it back to 5000 or less. 5k of vitamin d is fine but you need 100 mg of vitamin k2 for every 1k of vitamin d or you could get hypercalcemic if you do it long term. That could cause funny symptoms like excessive thirst or palpitations and calcium also has a critical value. And depending on what your baseline vitamin d is but thats the general rule at any vitamin d dose. As someone said you could react to the ashwaganda but i do fine at that 400 morning and night. Zinc can cause nausea in some and that's kinda high for zinc but picolnate has some reasons for it i can't remember. It's a little high but i know people do take high doses.

comment,mspg6u9,1kn5sm0,1,,,1,"This is exactly what I came here to say. A few months ago, I dove pretty hard into supplements to help manage my multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammation and chronic constipation. I started with two forms of magnesium: 200 mg of glycinate and 200 mg of citrate. On top of that, I was also taking high doses of Fish oil, CoQ10, DHEA, Alpha-lipoic acid, and a calming/melatonin/anxiety blend. That last one made me super dizzy and actually more anxious and jittery than calm.

Looking back, I think the issue was starting everything at once instead of easing in. I ended up resetting and reintroducing supplements one at a time, starting with low doses and adding a new one every two weeks. That made it so much easier to notice any side effects and figure out what was causing what. Since doing that, I haven‚Äôt had any major issues, and I‚Äôm now gradually increasing doses.

Also, just a note‚Äîmagnesium plus vitamin A can be a pretty intense combo at higher doses. I was later advised to start magnesium at around 40 mg and slowly build up. The type of magnesium you choose matters too; different forms serve different purposes and are absorbed differently. From what I‚Äôve learned, magnesium glycinate tends to be the most bioavailable and well-tolerated form.

All that being said, I am in absolutely no way an expert or even super knowledgeable. I am 100% just giving my experience and I know everyone is different, needs different supplement and dosage. I think this is all a great first. Step to get ideas but definitely seek out an expert and research as much as you can. No, these are not prescription meds but they can harm us just the same.

comment,mshipgy,1kn5sm0,2,,,3,"I mainly suggest it for people with a very common inherited condition where in their bloodline they get osteopenia, osteoporosis or cognitive decline. You can‚Äôt have to high of cortisol in the various compartments of your body without having the adrenaline there as well. The ashwagandha definitely helps with the anxiety which is important because when your are anxious you relentlessly dump adrenaline and cortisol into your body from your adrenal glands. The ashwagandha isn‚Äôt enough to really do the job to dampen the adrenal function but it does help. To actually get their adrenal function under control I suggest Taurine @ 500mg 2x a day to be taken with the Ashwagandha. This is basically a miracle combination for these families. It‚Äôs a very tangible benefit for them. It‚Äôs definitely a benefit for me as well they aren‚Äôt coming in absolutely demolished at every visit and some of these families have a very bad ratio of osteoclasts to osteoblasts so much so I can tell when they‚Äôve missed a dose. It‚Äôs just amazing how fierce and fast bone remodeling is.

When the long-term results have been compared, that is, after six or eight weeks of continuous use, what was demonstrated by using twenty grams is a difference in the speed of action, that is, the people who used 20 grams per day showed a faster onset of cognitive benefit, but in the long run, when measured by different objective tests, the effectiveness of the two regimens, that of veintegramos per day and that of 5 grams per day, was the same.",eltoraxico,1747312794.0,,,,

Certain indivduals are sensitive to methylated B vitamins like methylcobalamin and methylfolate, which can greatly overstimulate the nervous system and cause anxiety.
I've had many clients with this problem. This is generally due to genetics (like MTHFR or COMT variants).  The other comment about taking niacin (50‚Äì100 mg) can often calm the reaction, may take up to an hour. If you don't take any more methylated vitamins the symptoms usually fade within 1 to 3 days. If you choose to supplement b vitamins,  I would suggest alternatives that include hydroxocobalamin for B12 and folinic acid instead of methylfolate. You'll have a way better response.

Not every individual with an MTHFR mutation benefits from methylated B vitamins..

I literally went to a clinic for anxiety once a week. I would meet up with a group inside this hospital and we would all talk about our anxiety and the counselors would try to help. It was fucking crazy lol   Long story short everybody had crazy anxiety from the most random things ever, like there was people there that had phobias of a dog where if they seen a dog they would nearly pass out. And then there was me talking about how I had two girls I was falling in love with at the same time lol. 

Ultimately, after like six months of going to the group, I never had anxiety again, and I think that was because I realized how so many other people had it worse than me over things much simpler that I appreciate easy ‚Ä¶.

comment,mse3ak9,1kmxbp2,2,,,1,"K2 at proper doses prevents the calcium problem that people always worry about with high-dose vitamin D3. Before phones and the internet, people were getting anywhere from 10,000 to 30,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day just from sun exposure,  every single day. Evolution hasn't had nearly enough time to reduce that need. Our biology is still built for those levels.

The dose range most people talk about. 600 to 800 IU,  only considers bone health. It‚Äôs based on outdated and incorrect research from the IOM. They made a calculation error that was never fixed. Worse, the studies they used only included people who already had sufficient vitamin D3 levels, so obviously, the numbers are completely off for people who are deficient.

That research was reanalyzed, and it showed that the average person actually needs around 8,895 IU per day to reach optimal levels. Not just for bones, but for full-body health. And yes, people can go above that without problems. The so-called ‚Äúupper limit‚Äù is flexible, especially when you're taking vitamin K2, which prevents calcium from going to the wrong places like arteries or kidneys.


And thank you, I did a lot of research. My plan is to give my brain enough for it to repair it's neurotransmitters and get them back to normal base and healthy levels, before depression.",Haunting-Ad9105,1747280248.0,,,,

Doctor's Best has it both in capsule and powder form, and the unflavored powder has no fillers so I got that (although it isn't actually more affordable, in contrast with some other supplements that cost less in powder).

Many reviewers said it tastes so horribly of fish that even putting a little bit (i.e. probably a fraction of a serving) can ruin a strong-flavored beverage, and someone even suggested to ""hold your nose while drinking and immediately brush your teeth afterwards so you don't get traumatized and become fearful of consuming it again"".

What the hell is all the drama about? The label itself also suggests drinking it with fruit juice/beverage, so they know it's not palatable, but damn was I ""disappointed"". I tried half a scoop in some lemonade (the glass is on the large size, ~350 ml/12 oz) ‚Äî I could barely taste a hint of it. I then tried half a scoop in plain water ‚Äî it was a bit fishy, but totally doable. I could probably make it a whole scoop in a standard glass and it still won't be that bad.

And the same is also (and more-so) true for MSM powder: Just barely dissolved or straight on the tongue it's very chemical-y, but 2 grams in a large glass of water are practically imperceptible.

I had tremendous success and my breathing issue went away after only one week. However, after a couple of months of taking TTFD it started to give me extreme insatiable hunger to the point that I was unable to focus or function. Initially, this only happened when I would take a zinc supplement, but about two weeks after I increased TTFD to 200mg, the hunger came back even though I had discontinued the zinc. I tried reducing the TTFD, but my hunger did not resolve and I also began experiencing an exacerbation of a usually mild health issue I have called persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD), which thiamine was initially treating. Zinc also exacerbated my PGAD when I took it in the past (prior to starting thiamine).

Thiamine HCL is also causing these symptoms for me and I‚Äôve developed such an intolerance to thiamine that taking just one dose will cause the PGAD and extreme hunger to go on for a week after taking it. I have adverse reactions to many medications and supplements, but usually they just worsen my fatigue or breathing issue. If anyone has any input on why this might be happening I would greatly appreciate your feedback.¬†",hazydaybreak,1747263696.0,5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kmt6s8/thiamine_causing_extreme_hunger_and_pgad/

submission,1kms2rs,,0,"I take 23 capsules a day to benefit my gym performance. If anyone has very good knowledge of supplements, please may you make sure there‚Äôs no miss info in my description below",0.44,,"Creatine
Creatine is a naturally occurring compound found primarily in red meat and synthesized in the body from the amino acids glycine, arginine, and methionine. It plays a critical role in the rapid production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body‚Äôs primary energy currency, particularly during short bursts of high-intensity activity such as weightlifting or sprinting. Supplementation increases intramuscular phosphocreatine stores, allowing for more efficient ATP regeneration. This translates to improved performance, including the ability to complete an additional one to two repetitions during resistance training. Creatine has also been linked to potential cognitive benefits, including enhanced memory and mental performance, particularly under conditions of mental fatigue or stress.

Athlete Stack (Male Multivitamin Complex)
A high-potency multivitamin designed to support physiological performance, recovery, and general health. Key components include:
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin A ‚Äì Essential for visual function (via its role in the visual cycle), immune response, and cellular growth and differentiation.
	‚Ä¢	Beta-Carotene ‚Äì A provitamin A carotenoid with antioxidant properties, converted in the body to vitamin A. It helps neutralize free radicals, reducing oxidative stress linked to chronic diseases.
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) ‚Äì A fat-soluble vitamin that enhances calcium absorption in the gut, supporting bone mineralization and immune modulation. It plays a key role in maintaining serum calcium and phosphate concentrations.
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin E (Tocopherol) ‚Äì Acts as a lipid-soluble antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage. It also supports skin health and immune defense.
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin K2 (Menaquinone) ‚Äì Involved in calcium metabolism. It activates proteins such as osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein, which direct calcium to bones and prevent vascular calcification.
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) ‚Äì Required for carbohydrate metabolism and energy production via the citric acid cycle.
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) ‚Äì Functions as a coenzyme (FAD and FMN) in redox reactions critical for metabolism of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.
	‚Ä¢	Niacin (Vitamin B3) ‚Äì A precursor to NAD+/NADP+, crucial coenzymes in cellular respiration and energy production. It also supports nervous system function.
	‚Ä¢	Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5) ‚Äì Integral in the synthesis of coenzyme A, which is essential for fatty acid metabolism, steroid hormone synthesis, and maintenance of healthy skin and hair.
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) ‚Äì Required for DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and maintenance of neurological function.
	‚Ä¢	Biotin (Vitamin B7) ‚Äì Supports metabolic pathways involved in fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid catabolism.

Additional Minerals:
	‚Ä¢	Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium ‚Äì Electrolytes essential for muscle function, bone health, and enzymatic activity.
	‚Ä¢	Zinc ‚Äì Involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions, supporting immunity, wound healing, and DNA synthesis.
	‚Ä¢	Copper, Selenium, Iodine ‚Äì Trace elements necessary for antioxidant defense (e.g., selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase), thyroid function, and red blood cell production.
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) ‚Äì A water-soluble antioxidant important for collagen synthesis, immune function, and iron absorption.

Immunity Capsules
Formulated to support the innate and adaptive immune systems. These likely contain vitamins such as C and D, zinc, and possibly herbal extracts like echinacea or elderberry, which are known to modulate immune responses and reduce the duration of illness.

Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oil)
Comprising EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), omega-3s support cardiovascular, neurological, and joint health:
	‚Ä¢	Reduce triglyceride levels and improve lipid profiles.
	‚Ä¢	Improve endothelial function and blood circulation.
	‚Ä¢	Exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, beneficial for joint integrity and recovery.
	‚Ä¢	Support brain health and may reduce the risk or progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs.

Zinc & Magnesium (Often in ZMA form)
These minerals are critical for recovery, sleep quality, and muscle repair:
	‚Ä¢	Zinc supports immune function, protein synthesis, and enzymatic activity.
	‚Ä¢	Magnesium aids in over 300 biochemical reactions, including those involved in ATP synthesis, muscle relaxation, and nervous system regulation.
Together, they contribute to restorative sleep, muscle repair post-exercise, and enhanced immune resilience.

Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)
An adaptogenic herb used to reduce physiological stress and anxiety. Its active compounds (e.g., withanolides) help lower cortisol levels, which may enhance muscle hypertrophy by reducing catabolic signaling. Ashwagandha also supports mood, cognitive performance, and endocrine function.",Ok-Reputation148,1747260632.0,5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kms2rs/i_take_23_capsules_a_day_to_benefit_my_gym/

comment,msc42ns,1kmpm25,4,,,0,"Best multivitamin I can recommend is probably NOW Adam. Life Extension makes a few. They have a very affordable 1 a day that's around $15 for 60 days.  It's quite affordable. I'll let others recommend any other vitamins or minerals you may be lacking. The full name is ""Life Extension One-Per-Day Multivitamin"" and it has the relative correct forms. You're not wasting money on a lower quality product like Centrum or whatever. 





 I'll give you the same advice I gave an online acquaintance who was quite obese but working towards a goal of weight loss. I do not talk with this person anymore but I'm  currently aware they're still at it.  

I want to be honest with you. I've never been fat myself. Not even close. However, I do know that making sudden dietary changes even if you're on the other side of the scale are a massive shock to your personal well being. Losing weight is simple thermodynamics. There is some sway here and there if you have any autoimmune issues or handle food differently. 

Make small adjustments over time, that way the tastes, smells or textures don't offend your senses. If you like 70/30 burgers, that's fine it's greasy and tastes good but it's bad for you. Next time mix 70/30 and 75/25. Then 75/25 and 80/20. And so on. 

Write down the typical stuff you eat in a week, sit back and think what adjustments you can slowly incorporate with your normal food and still eat better. Or what you can add to add micros to your diet and improve other things. If you enjoy junk food, keep it, but reduce it when you can or ask yourself if it's worth eating if you've only got an urge for it. With fruit and vegetables, be smart about it. Be creative. There's a lot of good resources out there for this. Sauces and seasonings help a lot with plain vegetables. Just be smart with the caloric rich sauces. Depending on your estimated TDEE and weight, you could cruise down on the scale by diet and then incorporate exercise later on.

I think most people who dole out advice online or in person assume sudden changes are easy. They aren't. Slowly changing and swapping choices works better. There's still some surprise Pikachu going on with flavors and textures, but it's less of an assault on your senses than sudden ones.


A good example of a change over time would be the following.


Say you like two slices of Wonderbread (IDK if this brand still exists), big portion of Nutella, big portion of Skippy or whatever. Over time you can change the one slice to something like Oroweat's Double Fiber (I think they operate under different names depending on where you live). Then the second slice. Then reduce or swap out the Nutella for a better quality product. Then change the peanut butter to a natural one in small amounts. And so forth. 

If I ripped your usual out of your hands and I gave you a high fiber bread sandwich with Justin's or similar and Scudder peanut butter you'd soon throw it at my face.


When I say be smart about the vegetables and fruit, what I mean is think before eating some of them. Some stuff just isn't worth eating because they're calorie dense, don't carry much micros and it doesn't matter if you need 1200, 2000, 3000, or 5000 calories a day. 

You could sautee in oil, 400 g of zucchini or yellow squash and still be under than eating a 150 g banana, like way under, and have more nutrients, and it be more filling. And it's savory and naturally sweet.

I would definitely consult with a physician before you make any decisions. Ultimately, your health and a professional's expertise are the best course of action. Ultimately, everyone needs fruits and vegetables in their diets. I don't eat enough, but I take a set of superfruit and veggie vitamins every day (Superfood MD brand). It seems to help with energy and overall thinking capabilities.

Here is a list of well vetted brands that seem to work for most people.

[Fruit and Veggie Supplements](https://kalodynestudios.com/which-fruit-veggie-supplement-is-right-for-you/)

Once again, I would speak with your doctor first before changing anything drastically. Still, our bodies do need the nutrients in fruits and vegetables. Shakes are another option to choose too. I usually use an 1/8th cup spinach, a 1/2 cup blueberries, an 1/8th cup greek yogurt, and one banana. They say oat milk would probably be the best to mix in (add a little ice to give a frothy consistency), but I use regular 2% cows milk.

comment,msd8tl0,1kmoqmb,1,,,0,"This is a subject I‚Äôve researched in great depth. Here are some quick points. First, You are fine. There is zero proof of causation between vitamin c and kidney stones. I have read the studies multiple times and there is a correlation but there isn‚Äôt causation. No worries at all on that point. Also the worst thing that can acutely happen as a result of too much vitamin c is a serious case of diarrhea. At 46 grams I would think you‚Äôre at that point but it‚Äôs different for everyone. It‚Äôs called bowel tolerance. Once you hit bowel tolerance you will hit the toilet and that‚Äôs it. I would not do that every day but doing it every once in a while is not a problem. In fact that‚Äôs a great way to cure a cold or a cough. It will knock out a cold in a matter of hours if you catch it early enough.  Bottom line is you‚Äôre safe.

I‚Äôm looking for a whey protein that mixes extremely well, preferably even in water (not just milk). I‚Äôve tried a few brands, but many still get clumpy or have that ‚Äúgritty‚Äù texture.

My priorities are:
	‚Ä¢	excellent mixability
	‚Ä¢	good taste would be nice

I just want a shake that I can quickly mix in a shaker (even on the go) and get a smooth drink without lumps or sandiness.

What are your recommendations?
Any brands you really trust? (Bonus points if they‚Äôre easy to get in Switzerland.)

Thanks a lot for your tips!

I'll give you the 5 things I've kind of put together. I'm not on any medication, my blood pressure is pretty decent, as far as I know the only thing I'm allergic to is a single medication, and will add a basic multi-vitamin with the following. Thank you in advance!

Sladak Naturals Testosterone Booster - Ashwagandha, L-Arginine, Tongkat Ali, Tribulus

Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder \*\*Changed protein as the other also had BCAA, this is just whey.

Nutricost Nitric Oxide Booster 2250mg, 180 Capsules (Not sure if needed, I found back in my teens it helped with blood flow and oxygen levels)

Nutricost BCAA 1000mg, 500 Capsules (250 Serv), 2:1:1 Branched Chain Amino Acids (500mg of L-Leucine, 250mg of L-Isoleucine and L-Valine)

Optimum Nutrition Micronized Creatine Monohydrate Powder, Unflavored, 60 Servings, 300 Grams

If youve recently started excersising and using pre-workout these both lower amounts of adenosine buildup. Adenosine is what makes you sleepy and excersise and caffeine can both keep this from building up during the day.

Does anyone know if the dosage is truly 1mg before factoring in bac?

I don't want to be taking too much

comment,msehhgq,1kmipgn,1,,,0,"Reflux is not only caused by diet.

If you have slipping rib syndrome, it won‚Äôt matter how well & pure you eat, you‚Äôll suffer from GERD. 

1,000 years ago people with GERD died young. 

Twinpeaks gave great advice on dietary changes you should make.

You should be tested for allergies to see if they‚Äôre setting things off.

Other supplements to try are drinking bentonite clay and zeolite clay, if it‚Äôs particularly bad. Henry‚Äôs brand is the only effective aloe Vera brand I‚Äôve ever found. Plantain herb and fruit, although unrelated, also help. Supplement glutamine. Colostrum. Mangosteen. 

If you‚Äôre GERD is severe enough none of these things will work and you will have to continue omeorazole. If that is the case, you will need to supplement b-12, calcium, and ensure you consume enough protein, preferably through animal meat. If you eat eggs, be wary of egg whites as they break down the protective lining of the stomach and gut. Egg yolks are fine.

If GERD continues, you should have your stomach and duodenum scoped.

Also, if your GERD is a symptom of slipping rib syndrome, a telltale sign is the sound of popping or cracking of the ribs and/or sternum. It‚Äôs difficult to get diagnosed but if you are, SRS can only be fixed with surgery. 

I have done everything under the sun and though some things helped short term, it always got worse. I have had my final SRS surgery and I have been able to slowly cut down my omeprazole dosage.

Do you take probiotics? Quit eating garbage... fresh food (you'll adjust to this over time making it yourself).  Also if you go to the GERD forum on here you will also run into folks who stopped taking PPIs because their doctors put them on an anti-depressant.  It literally resolved their GERD (gut-brain axis). I personally think PPIs are worse than anti-depressants but don't' like either but for 6-12 months until the brain can re-wire itself out of an anxious state, its worth it.  Anyway, research the heck out of it and try one thing at a time, but the food intolerance testing saved me (I was doubled over in pain with GERD within a few hours of eating it got worse. After testing it took 3 weeks to clear it from my system but I was intolerant to wheat, cow dairy and egg whites at the age of 45 - it seemed to come out of nowhere too).

As someone mentioned previously, PPI's cause vitamin and mineral deficiencies because we need a low pH to break down the food.  PPI shut off the hydorcholic acid production by the stomach.  An alternative is Alka Seltzer Original instead.  It is an antacid with aspirin.  Aspirin is a spin off of Willow Bark Tea, used for centuries Some herbal remedies, including willow bark, are traditionally used to maintain digestive function and manage discomfort associated with minor stomach upset. Willow bark's gentle properties are sometimes considered a natural approach to digestive health.¬† As it is already disolved you do not have the aspirin burning the stomach lining, as in tablet aspirin.

Celiac Disease affects around 1% of the population.  On the other hand Non Celiac Gluten Sensitivity affects 10%.  Other than ruling out Celiac Disease, then showing improvement on gluten free diet, and then the symptoms return with a gluten trial, there are no diagnostic tests. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) was first identified¬†in the early 1980s.  That was 10 years after Norman Borlaug recieved the Nobel Peace Prize (1970) for his work on Modern Wheat.  Dr Davis, ""Wheat Belly"" is a good resource.

It is estimated that 90% of industrialized nations do not eat enough Choline. Betaine methioned in a post earlier, is a metabolite of choline.  Choline deficiency affects brain health (acetylcholine), gall bladder health (bile salts for fat digestion, and Phosphadityl Choline makes up most of our cell membranes.  Eggs and beef, are our primary source.

Get vitamin D tested.  The optimum is 80 ng/ml, where you get uncomprimised immune sysyem against autoimmune disease, infections and cancer; improved mental health and bone health.  The Medical recommendation of >29 ng/ml is based only on avoiding Rickets.  The experts say all the research done is ""irrelevant""

Iodine intake in the US dropped 50% from 1970 until today.  Thyroxine prescriptions have doubled with the increase in hypothyroidism. Iodine is essential to kill defective cells and promote wound healing.  No wonder cancer is increasing.

There is a disease caused by Thiamine B1 deficiency called Gastrointestinal Beriberi.  Fits your symptoms.  It is rarely checked for. A simple test is to simply supplement thiamine at greater than 100 mg a day.  It is one of the first B vitamins to get depleted.

The average American diet has around 14 omega 6 to omega 3 ratio. Optimum is around 3:1.  Wheat flour is 22:1. Grass fed organic milk is 1:1 while commercial milk is 5:1. And grassfed milk tastes better.

My suggestion:

Investigate gluten sensitivity.

Reduce the starches to lower the omega 6:3 ratio in your diet.

Supplement with vitamin D but do not supplement Calcium (I take 10,000 IU a day).  Vitamin D increases absorption of calcium.  Studies that report Calcification supplement calcium, those that do not, have no reports of calcification from vitamin D, even at mega doses as high as 1 million IU. 5,000 to 10,000IU a day is safe for most people and will eventually raise your blood level 25(OH)vitamin D.  The homeostasis level is 70 to 100 ng/ml. 

 Phosphadityl Choline,( target about 600 mg of choline a day (safe upper limit is 3500 mg).

Supplement 600 mg a day with Liquid Iodine safe upper limit is 1000 mcg (1 gram) but in Japan the safe upper limit is 3000 mcg.

Take 100 mg of Thiamine, several times a day.  There is no established upper limit (UL) for thiamin (vitamin B1) intake.

So living with an autoimmune condition it‚Äôs a no brainer to me to keep inflammation to a minimum. 

Organic soil is more nutrient dense, the crops grow more naturally, rather than water dense farming for growth in conventional farming. From my experience, many organic produce I buy tastes much better than conventional ‚Äî berries are juicier for example and aren‚Äôt water dense like many conventional grown fruits are (blueberries that look jumbo for example and have no taste).

Organic farmers often use other methods first before spraying more pesticides such as companion planting, natural pest predators, and crop rotation. 

Organic farms also use fewer total types of pesticide compounds, and residues on food are generally lower. So ‚Äúmore‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúmore toxic‚Äù or ‚Äúmore harmful‚Äù and often it's not even more in quantity, just more varied timing or technique.

So not all organic is going to be good, it might be misleading. Maybe their crop got really affected and they had to use more pesticides. You‚Äôll never know that though.

But to say their pesticide use are unregulated and it‚Äôs just marketing is completely false. Year after year, USDA testing shows that organic foods consistently have fewer and lower pesticide residues. 

People looking to improve their health should really just be eating whole food diets, organic or not.

The last surgery repaired 3 at the end of the year. 5 months later and I‚Äôm starting to naturally be able to lower my PPI dose and supplements make a little bit of difference. But I still have months to go til my rib cage is aligned like a rib cage should be. I also had intercostal surgery 3 weeks ago which left me collapsed on my right side from my mid & lower thoracic, at all times, which also is starting to improve this past week which also helps my body not be contorted into itself. 

It is very difficult to get diagnosed with either injury, especially the latter. And even rarer for surgery to be done to correct it (there is no other way to correct SRS or permanent intercostal nerve damage). 

It‚Äôs like that Shakespeare quote, there‚Äôs more things in heaven and earth than you can conceive‚Ä¶ and with that, comes having to choose between lesser evils. I don‚Äôt want to be on opioids full time either, but my body literally breaks down from the pain (including perforating ulcers) if I don‚Äôt. 

There‚Äôs no one size fits all, just suggestions. Try this‚Ä¶if it doesn‚Äôt work try this‚Ä¶if that doesn‚Äôt work, you may be stuck with this to function. Either that or assisted suicide.

PS. In case this slipped by you: It didn‚Äôt get worse for any other reason than my SRS got worse and spread to other ribs. Without effort my dosage of omeprazole is decreasing just by improvement/healing of the stability of my rib cage. 

Also, SRS is a wildly underdiagnosed condition as it requires a specific type of scan that only specific specialists can read, and the number of specialists are small in number. In addition, recognition/diagnosis and repair of permanently damaged intercostal nerves is so, so much further behind.",No_Map_73,1747349301.0,,,,
submission,1kmhf2h,,0,MSM for Hair Growth/Side Effects?,0.5,,"Hi all! So I recently have been trying to grow out my hair, and someone told me to spray MSM mixed with water on my scalp and also to take it in a powder form daily in the morning. 

I know MSM is an anti inflammatory supplement, but I am skeptical on it growing hair. Im more likely to believe it grows hair when ingested but Im not sure the science behind that growing hair faster either. 

One of my big worries is heart palpatations, acne, migraines, and panic, as those are things I already deal with.

So is MSM safe to try out? How much should I take to start? I plan to take it with vitamin C as many suggested that and Im not worried about water intake as I usually slam through 4 or 5 40oz water bottles per day, but the side effects really worry me.

comment,ms9dtei,1kmc86v,1,,,0,"Ideally, you should take it in divided doses of 600mg each (or a max of 1,000mg) spread throughout the day, and on an empty stomach. 

It's difficult to check all of the above boxes, because at some point you will be eating, so at least the ""empty stomach"" ideal won't be fulfilled. Meals are okay if they are primarily carbs and / or fat. Proteins on the other hand are amino-acids, just like cysteine, so they compete with cysteine for absorbtion.

You want divided doses for two distinct reasons: 1. lower amounts of anything get absorbed better than higher amounts: this is pretty much a universal principle of supplementation; and 2. NAC has a short half-life, so it makes sense to take divided doses, to have multiple plasma peak levels throughout the day.",Duduli,1747226345.0,,,,

submission,1km3yqb,,4,"Help build my kitchen sink stack for Anxiety, Depression, ADHD, OCD, BED",0.83,,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm 26, diagnosed with anxiety, depression, ADHD, OCD, and binge eating disorder. I've been on SSRIs since I was 20, and a year ago, I added Vyvanse. While Vyvanse initially helped, I‚Äôm now dealing with mental fatigue, reduced endurance, and worsening tics as the effects have worn off.

To improve my health, I‚Äôve made several changes, including starting TRT, using peptides (SS-31, NAD+, MOTS-C), and adding supplements like Omega-3, Vitamin D3, magnesium, taurine, and creatine. I‚Äôve also been running, lifting weights, and doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), but I still feel mentally drained. Currently, I‚Äôm on 50mg Vyvanse and 10mg Viibryd (I recently switched from Trintellix).

My main goal is to biohack myself into a stable baseline. I‚Äôm not chasing the idea of feeling ""awesome"" all the time, I just want consistency‚Äîfeeling alive, having energy to engage in conversations, and not feeling ""dead inside."" I want to get off Vyvanse first, and then maybe even Viibryd. I‚Äôm also aiming to recover my libido (currently zero), stop overeating (stress and dopamine-driven cravings), and continue managing my mental health with supplements.

I‚Äôve already ruled out some ""riskier"" or cyclic supplements (like lithium orotate, SAMe, 5-HTP, St. John‚Äôs Wort), but I‚Äôm looking for advice or recommendations on managing cravings, boosting libido, or improving mental health.

I‚Äôm about to order the following supplements:

* Magnesium L-threonate (crosses the blood-brain barrier)
* Bacopa Monnieri
* Lion‚Äôs Mane
* Cordyceps
* Rhodiola
* Reishi
* Citicoline
* NAC
* Glycine (to pair with NAC)
* Full-spectrum mushrooms?? confused on this one
* Vitamin E
* L-Tyrosine
* L-Theanine
* Ginkgo Biloba (for libido)
* Vitamin B complex
* Ginseng
* Uridine??(TBD)

I‚Äôll be ordering most of these from iHerb, and I‚Äôm looking at brands like Swanson, Doctor‚Äôs Best, Life Extension, California Gold Nutrition, and Now. I‚Äôve also seen a lot of people recommend Real Mushrooms for quality mushroom supplements, as many mushroom products seem to be underdosed or ineffective.

Currently, I‚Äôm taking **Sports Research Omega-3**, which is a bit expensive, so if anyone has good recommendations for a more affordable option, that would be great.

Any suggestions or recommendations on brands, dosing, add/subtract supplements, your experience is welcome!

I appreciate you all <3",pbx_01,1747188576.0,8,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1km3yqb/help_build_my_kitchen_sink_stack_for_anxiety/

submission,1km3lxa,,9,has anyone else felt happier on NAC?,1.0,,"I've had ocd and depression symptoms since I was 14; i'm going on 18 now.

this year i've been taking NAC on and off. i forgot the dosage lol but they're in lil capsules. in every period that I've taken it consistently, one thing I've noticed is that I'd get happier and more energetic.

i still get sad, yes. i still get anxious, yes. however, I actually feel motivated to do my schoolwork and reach my goals. i feel more social, and more open to trying new things! i don't feel the usual urge to lay in bed and mope around.

has anyone else noticed a mood improvement while taking NAC supplements?

I‚Äôm a guy in my 30s looking to optimize my health, energy levels, and long-term wellness. I eat fairly balanced, exercise a few times a week, and try to stay active, but I know that nutritional gaps can still exist even with a decent lifestyle.

	‚Ä¢	Magnesium (glycinate or citrate)

comment,ms7pbgm,1km1gxm,18,,,0,"Same age range as you. My stack is very similar. I use a high quality multivitamin with separates doses taken with meals. 

I haven't bothered buying a ZMA ~~since I get enough quality vitamin A from my diet and multivitamin.~~  I had a major brain fart while shopping for something else and writing this up. The B6 in most ZMAs is a poor form, and if it's the good form the other ingredients are often poorer forms. Build your own stack. Thanks to /u/MathematicianFar6725 for noticing this error. In any case, a P5P B6 is best. For most, you can go with the ZM portion alone. For the zinc, I've been using monomethionine or any of the labeled Optizincs. For the magnesium part, I've always bought bisglycinate form. It doesn't bother my GI like cheaper forms do, and speaking for myself seems to have a better calming and relaxing effect on my muscles. 

**Vitamin D3** is fine. If you carry a lot of fat, you may need a higher dosage. Though the difference is so small you can ignore this. 

**Fish oil** is great, but focus on a good quality fish oil with a good EPA/DHA combination. You'll want to speak to your doctor whether the standard dose is better or a therapeutic dose would be better. Also, look into algae based omega-3. There's no conversion loss. It's allegedly the real deal. Supposed to be mercury risk free. My doctor has me OK'd to take 1,200-1,700 mg EPA/DHA. No cholesterol or cardiovascular issues. 

**B-Complex:** This is tough. There are a lot of B-Complexes out there with cheaper forms of B vitamins in them. You'll pay a little more but getting the most bioavailable forms is better. I would, though, highly recommend buying a separate B12 that uses methylcobalmin you place under the tongue. GI absorption of B12 is poor. Buccal or sublingual absorption is better barring injections from your doctor. There's other delivery methods, too, but I've never tried them. I don't go crazy with the B12 choice here. I look for methylcobalmin and buy a USP certified one from Costco in cherry flavor. 


**Ashwagandha**. I've been using it since college. A long time. The only times I cycled off of the stuff my brain full sent me into a stressful mess. Again, a quality brand matters here. 

I don't bother with OTC **probiotics** at all. I eat a ton of homemade saurkraut and store bought yogurt. Even make my own yogurt sometimes. I would focus more on prebiotics to feed any organisms in your gut. Some foods we eat naturally have prebiotic qualities. But you can always help them along. There's a breadth of supplements out there. I take chicory root based inulin. It'll be brutal the first week, but you won't have any gas issues after. I take anywhere from 5-10 g a day. This is allegedly the therapeutic amount that will cause SCFA production to go up, specifically butyrate. More UPFs or extremely fatty foods will wreck your gut health. 


**OptiMSM or MSM** (non patented) is often debated. I use it. 2-4 g a day. I take mine with Optifiber (Kirkland's version of Benefiber) along with some water enhancer and a low Vitamin C capsule. You'll want the water enhancer unless you mix it in orange juice. It's quite bitter. I use a 24 ounce glass to dilute the bitterness down but still taste it.  It makes some difference for me. I'll cycle off of it every so often for a few weeks to a month. Glucosamine chondroitin may be helpful. At this point in your life you should focus on foods that may help with inflammation. Even if it's a little bit. No pill or supplement will help without some internal changes. 


Also, like **fiber**. Whole foods or supplements. Opt for anything with fiber anytime you eat. Drink plenty of fluids. Avoid alcohol as much as you can. I've been pushing 40-60 g of fiber daily for years and years. Gut motility has a huge effect on your overall health outside whether you got a fast poop session or not.


**Soluble:** Clumps everything together.  
**Insoluble:** Like a Swiffer, it pushes things along. 


Find a balance between the two. Too much of either one can cause issues. The perfect balance is like having your ass sing an aria.",OhFuckNoNoNoMyCaat,1747194686.0,,,,

I take it maybe once or twice a week. I believe Rainbow Light, Solaray, Life Extension, etc. 

I tend to switch multi brands from time to time. There is one I use every few months which has the correct forms of everything.

There's only so much bland steamed vegetables or sauteed ones or roasted you could eat to counteract the glut of non-fiberous foods in dining halls.


Psyllium is very unique as  fiber. It's mostly soluble with a small amount being insoluble, but it has properties that mimic something like beta-glucans in its ability to soak up bile among other things for the body to exit out.

Off the top of my head, it uses the correct forms save for their B6 which is split between pyridoxine HCL and P5P. It comes in iron-free format, too.

Life Extension and Thorne make similar ones, too, but I've only bought LE a few times, and never used anything from Thorne. 

I personally prefer split doses. I have a very good idea of what I'm getting from actual food each day so I don't always take the 2-4 doses.

submission,1km0at3,,2,Saffron Extract for Insomnia,0.75,,"Advice needed

I have SEVERE primary insomnia that suddenly got exponentially worse after I reached menopause. I was already taking ALOT of nutritional supplements for sleep including some of the strongest supplements I could find‚Äîmagnolia bark extract, CBD oil, california poppy extract, valerian, glycine, Theanine, melatonin, lemon balm, passionflower, holy basil, sensoril Ashwaganda, lavender extract, natural progesterone cream, calcium/magnesium & more. I also have a mild mood disorder. I think a lot of my sleep issues are caused by hormones. 

Recently, my insomnia got worse & I needed to add something new to help me sleep. 
Even with all my supplements, I normally get only 5-5.5 hours sleep on weeknights & up to 6 or 6.5 hours on weekends.  I wear a sleep tracker wristband at night so i know my exact sleep times & REM, deep sleep & light sleep. 

I had on occasion taken Saffron extract before & it seemed to help, so I bought a bottle of Solaray Saffron extract (30 mg Affron extract) & took it before bed. This saffron extract is significantly stronger than what I took in the past, but I can‚Äôt find the (15 mg) Saffron & soy gummies I used to take. I think they‚Äôre discontinued.  After taking the Solaray Saffron, I thought I‚Äôd found the holy grail for insomnia.  Not only did I sleep much better, my usual anxiety was COMPLETELY GONE. The first night with the Solaray Saffron extract (Thursday), I slept approx. 6 hours, which is more than I usually sleep on weeknights. The second night (Friday), I slept 6 hrs 45 minutes. The 3rd night (Saturday), I slept a **whopping** 8 hours. I haven‚Äôt slept a whole 8 hours in one night for at least a year. I was ecstatic.  Then, on Sunday  night (4th night) the bottom fell out. I was anxious & couldn‚Äôt fall asleep no matter what I tried. Out of sheer desperation, I ended up taking an extra dose of CBD oil along with a strong drink of dry sherry. I fell asleep at 2:30 am & got slightly more than 4 hrs sleep. I felt like a zombie. 

I‚Äôm trying to figure out how I can continue to use Saffron for sleep. I have cyclothymia mood disorder, a mild form of Bipolar 2, which doesn‚Äôt usually require meds. Since saffron has mild antidepressant effects, it can (rarely) trigger symptoms of bipolar if taken in strong doses. I think this is what may be happening. 30 mg Saffron is considered a ‚Äúlow‚Äù dose, but I may be more sensitive to it than most people & it may be too strong for me. I searched Amazon for a Saffron supplement that only has 15 mg extract & only found one (Source Naturals) which unfortunately has Sorbitol added to it, which gives me digestive upset, but I ordered it anyway.  In the meantime, I will try to take the 30mg capsules apart & empty out half the powder to reduce them to half strength. 

If anyone has experience with Saffron, or knows of a good quality 15 mg Saffron extract **WITHOUT SORBITOL & OTHER ADDITIVES**, please let me know how I can optimize using Saffron for sleep.

submission,1klytop,,1,Exhausted all the time - What supplements may help?,0.67,,"I am unsure if I should be giving context to what ""exhausted all the time"" means.

This is normally how my day goes: 

I wake up at 5:40-6, I have a hard time getting out of bed as I still feel very tired after I wake up. Once I am up and doing my morning routine, I feel very awake and normal. I get to work for 7:45 and work until 2pm. 

At around 12pm, mid work day, I start to feel a lag. At this time I will usually eat something and have something with caffeine, either an Alani Energy or a coffee. By the time I get off at 2pm, I normally feel okay, 3pm I am starting to get a lag again in my day and this is where I start to feel tired. I then study most of the evening as I am a student, if I am not studying, I usually am reading in the evening. By 8pm I am literally ready to fall asleep, some evenings, I have a hard time staying awake.

My boyfriends posed concern as I will go to sleep, 9:30 at the latest, wake up at 5:40-6am the next morning, and still feel this tired through the days. I want to go to the gym in the days but feel too tired to do so. I got bloodwork done and talked to my doctor, nothing is off in that department that he can tell.

I'd say you could try ensuring that you're covering the basics: good amount of protein, healthy fats, adequate carbs intake, having all your electrolytes on point, maybe doing some yoga and full body relaxation routines. But beyond that, I suspect you will need some more tests done by a professional to figure out what may be causing the exhaustion, if diet isn't it.

I have sort of been through what you are describing. Waking up feeling unrested, feeling okayish for the morning, crashing around midday, crashing in the evening. My sleep was fixed by a combo of avocado as a snack and apigenin + glycine as supps. As for my midday (or essentially any) crashes, I found that the higher carb my diet is, the harder the crashes. So I went on a mostly protein and fats focused diet, with carbs just tagging along once in a while as a banana or other berries. I also started taking dopamine supportive supps like l-tyrosine and a good quality b-complex supp (where B6 is in P5P form). Been feeling quite good since these changes.

I remain surprised at how much I benefited from what felt like not a big sacrifice - just more mindful of sugar/carbs - and definitely some focus on better sleep but some of it went hand in hand - less sugar overall helped my sleep.

I‚Äôm a 30-year-old male and I‚Äôm currently going through a tough time mentally and physically. I‚Äôm dealing with the following issues:
	‚Ä¢	Depression and OCD
	‚Ä¢	Low self-confidence
	‚Ä¢	Weak ejaculation and low semen volume
	‚Ä¢	Occasional sensation of urine drop at the tip of the penis after urination
	‚Ä¢	Mild stiffness in the knees, especially when bending them for a while ‚Äì I feel the need to stretch them straight, which brings relief

I‚Äôm currently taking the following supplements (see image attached):
	‚Ä¢	Swanson Albion Zinc
	‚Ä¢	Qunol Magnesium (420 mg)
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin K2 + D3
	‚Ä¢	California Gold Nutrition Vitamin B Complex

	‚Ä¢	Qunol Ultra Omega-3 Fish Oil (1000 mg)
	‚Ä¢	California Gold Nutrition Iron (36 mg)
	‚Ä¢	Swanson Vitamin C ( 500 mg )

I would really appreciate your input on:
	1.	Are these supplements okay to take together?
	2.	Is there anything I should stop taking?
	3.	What should I add to help with my symptoms, especially for the mental health issues and sexual health?

I want to optimize my daily routine naturally before considering pharmaceutical options. Any suggestions or experiences shared would be super helpful.

	‚Ä¢	Weak urine flow
	‚Ä¢	Weak ejaculation
	‚Ä¢	Erectile dysfunction (mild to moderate)

I‚Äôve seen a doctor and ruled out any major health problems, but I‚Äôm still looking for ways to improve my urinary and sexual health. I‚Äôm very interested in hearing your experiences with herbal or over-the-counter supplements that helped with any of the above.

Some supplements I‚Äôve seen mentioned include:
	‚Ä¢	Saw Palmetto
	‚Ä¢	Pygeum
	‚Ä¢	Zinc
	‚Ä¢	L-Arginine
	‚Ä¢	Maca Root

	‚Ä¢	Beta-Sitosterol
	‚Ä¢	Pumpkin Seed Oil
	‚Ä¢	Stinging Nettle Root

If you‚Äôve tried any of these (or others), I‚Äôd love to hear:
	‚Ä¢	Which ones worked for you
	‚Ä¢	How long it took to see results
	‚Ä¢	Any side effects or combinations that worked better together

It has helped me massively. I had tried fibre previously but that just went the other way and gave me severe diarrhoea. This Citrate however gives me perfect lubricated bowel movements. 

I didn't even take it for this reason and took it for glycinate for sleep but damn this is the best thing to come out of it, would recommend magnesium Citrate to anyone. I haven't felt the glycinate sleep effects as of yet.

I do have a Magnesium Citrate bottle from Bluebonnet but it‚Äôs 400 mg which is a lot more magnesium that I‚Äôm used to (I think the Pure is 120mg) and I‚Äôm already taking the vitamin smoothie that includes 140 mg.

comment,ms2t2pc,1klimw2,8,,,0,"You'll want to see what the amount of elemental magnesium is in your cap.
Aim for a 1000mg cap with 200mg of elemental magnesium, take twice a day.

For anxiety support add 250mg L theanine sublingualky in the morning, another 250mg pure powder with 600mg glycine and 1/4 tsp l threonate at night with water or a juice. 600mg Gaba sublingually in the evening also helps and an L tyrosine during the day at 800mg to 1000mg helps.

L serine or a 200mg of pure sAME will also help with anxiety.
You can look at Selanak peptide which has done wonders for anxiety/depression  and associated co-morbidities. 

Anxiety is a methylation issue so you'll want to get some bloods done to test for MTHFR mutations/comt  or any other gene mutations that predispose you to anxiety and then supplement accordingly. In my experience this is the best way to supplement.

In terms of safety these are all aminos and you do want to start off small doses and see what's best. They're all safe as long as dosage is correct.",Ready-Huckleberry-68,1747138020.0,,,,
comment,ms2ulpc,1klimw2,6,,,0,"You‚Äôre smart to check in on this‚Äîmagnesium can be super helpful, but too much can backfire.

The general recommendation for magnesium from supplements is to stay under **350 mg/day**, since higher doses can lead to issues like diarrhea, low blood pressure, or even brain fog in some people. You‚Äôre currently getting:

* 140 mg from the smoothie (di-magnesium malate)
* 120 mg from glycinate
* Considering 400 mg from citrate

That would push your total to **660 mg/day**, which is pretty high. While glycinate and malate are well-tolerated, adding citrate might be overdoing it‚Äîespecially daily.

For anxiety, glycinate might be one of the best forms, so you may want to stick with the smoothie + glycinate combo for now. If you‚Äôre curious about how well your body‚Äôs actually using the magnesium, you can even do a simple urine magnesium test at home to check absorption and efficiency.

comment,ms6g2g0,1kld6oa,1,,,0,"That‚Äôs traditional western medicine talking. I dont know too many ppl who have a balanced diet. Even if they did it would likely be less that perfect. What exactly is a balanced diet seems questionable. Who decides that? The American Medical Association of brainwashed doctors . I think she‚Äôs right about ppl taking too much, but that‚Äôs still subjective. Your age has a lot to do with it as well as a wide spectrum  of possible interferences such as pollution, medications and whatever else you  encounter on life. 

I take a lot of supplements.  I‚Äôm 80 and don‚Äôt come close  to a balanced diet and have a multitude of ailments. The body stops producing its own vitamins as you transide into your 40s then 50s etc. I had cancer that I beat without any western medical intervention. Supplements were part of the solution. Not all. If your body is full of toxins than vitamins are not going to work. I think from what I‚Äôve learned is that you have to detox regularly. Detox is a huge topic. If you‚Äôve ever been on a subway platform at rush hour and the train pulls in and its already packed, then the doors open but there‚Äôs no room to get in. If your cells are full of toxins the vitamins can‚Äôt get absorbed. So detox regularly. Look it up. 

Don‚Äôt take muscle building supplements if you‚Äôre not muscle building. Don‚Äôt take vit  D if you get plenty of Sun. Don‚Äôt take vit C if you eat a lot of citrus. It all depends on a multitude of factors and her answer is very simplistic. Ppl say they don‚Äôt feel the vitamins. I feel the vitamins when I don‚Äôt have them. I feel less energetic and more susceptible to disease. Lack of supplements is when you notice their effect. Not usually when you take them.",HistorianStrict,1747178229.0,,,,

I was taking 2-3g fish oil (EPA in the AM, DHA in the PM), 4K iu D3 + k2, 15-30mg zinc picolnate (sp?) or zinc bisglcyinate for adult ADHD, 1/2 dose of Thorne basic nutrients multi, Thorne b12, Thorne meriva curcumin, CocoaVia cacao capsules for supposed cognitive benefits, Seed probiotic, digestive enzymes occasionally. 

I stopped all of the above recently and immediately the general malaise and uneasiness went away. Anecdotally, when I‚Äôve stopped one at a time in the past, I feel like I notice a correlation between the D3 and feeling a bit charged / aggressive, the fish oil seeming to correspond to increased anxiety and/or foggy brain feeling or headaches, the zinc also correlating to feel a bit edgy, the cacao possibly causing general malaise and headaches, and the seed probiotic either giving no effect or sometimes causing significant stomach distention and bloating, and potentially also some malaise and anxiety. 

My takeaway is that for whatever reason, after decades of taking variations of this daily stack as an athlete and just for general health optimization, I‚Äôm noticing a recent increase in negative mood, cognition, and mental symptoms, and I‚Äôm going to stop my daily stack entirely until I get some extensive bloodwork done.",Datatyze,1747239121.0,,,,

Unfortunately doctors aren't educated in the nuance of supplements or basic nutrition at all, so unless they're unusually self-educated, they just have no idea how any of these things work.

submission,1kl618p,,12,Going down the K2 rabbit hole ‚Äî does it actually do anything? Body of literature is based on fraud? MK-7 is not effectively metabolized by the body compared to MK-4 or is it the other way around?,0.81,,"Trying to understand this for a relative who has osteoporosis. I made my previous post about the safety of megadozing on MK-4 (https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kkaz11/megadozing_on_vitamin_k2_mk4_any_recent_study_on) after hearing about those ""Japanese studies"" where 45 mg was used. When searching for studies from Japan I found these two:
* Vitamin K2 (Menatetrenone) Effectively Prevents Fractures
and Sustains Lumbar Bone Mineral Density in Osteoporosis, 2000, Masataka Shiraki, Yumiko Shiraki, Choju Aoki, Masakazu Miura

* Low-dose vitamin K2 (MK-4) supplementation for 12 months improves bone metabolism and prevents forearm bone loss in postmenopausal Japanese women, 2013, Noriko Koitaya, Mariko Sekiguchi, Yuko Tousen, Yoriko Nishide, Akemi Morita, Jun Yamauchi, Yuko Gando, Motohiko Miyachi, Mami Aoki, Miho Komatsu, Fumiko Watanabe, Koji Morishita, Yoshiko Ishimi

The first study went like this:&#10;  
**Design:** 24-month randomized, open-label trial (so not double-blind)&#10;  
**Participants:** 241 Japanese osteoporotic women

**Intervention:**
* Control group: 150 mg/day elemental calcium

* Treatment group: 45 mg/day vitamin K2 (MK-4) + 150 mg/day calcium

**Outcomes:**
* Fracture prevention: The treated group had significantly fewer new fractures (11% vs. 30% in control; p = 0.0273)

* BMD: Lumbar BMD declined in the control group (‚àí3.3%) but remained stable in the treatment group (‚àí0.5%) over 24 months

* Biomarkers: Glu-osteocalcin (undercarboxylated OC) decreased significantly in the K2 group; total OC increased (suggesting improved bone formation); no change in bone resorption marker (DPD)

**Conclusion:** Vitamin K2 helped prevent fractures and preserve BMD, likely via enhanced OC carboxylation, even without marked suppression of bone resorption.

And the second study:&#10;  
**Design:** 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial&#10;  
**Participants:** 48 healthy postmenopausal Japanese women (ages 50‚Äì65)

**Intervention:**
* MK-4 group: 1.5 mg/day vitamin K2

* Control: Placebo

**Outcomes:**
* Forearm BMD: Declined in control group, but remained stable in MK-4 group

* Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC): Significantly decreased in MK-4 group (‚àí39% at 12 months)

* Bone quality marker (pentosidine): Decreased in MK-4 group; stable in control group

**Conclusion:** Even low-dose MK-4 (1.5 mg/day) improved markers of bone quality and helped maintain BMD in healthy women.

So, these two claim to have found significant therapeutic effects. Then someone on my previous post commented that K2 studies from Japan are not reliable, mentioning fraudulent researcher Yoshihiro Sato who perhaps began this 45 mg K2 supplementation craze ‚Äî using data which was possibly forged.

The two studies I mentioned don't cite him or any of his collaborators from what I can see, but perhaps it still taints the entire notion a bit? I will also mention that in the second study, they declared ""the forearm BMD in the control group had significantly decreased after 12 months. However, there was no significant decrease in BMD in the MK-4 group during the study period"", but their table shows -2.405% for control and -1.449% for MK-4 group, which is perhaps a significant difference but why is -1.449% ""no significant decrease"" in and of itself?

Then when I tried reading around about the problems with the available scientific literature, one comment mentioned there are other studies validating the efficacy and safety of high dose K2, linking to a 2006 study from Indonesia (which seems to have been funded in part by Japanese drug manufacturer Eisai) and a 2009 study from the USA (**EDIT:** Okay, the same may also true for the USA study as it ""received support"" from Eisai).

To make it short:
* *Vitamin K2 treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis 
in Indonesia, 2006:* The Purwosunu study showed clear benefit in osteoporotic women, suggesting baseline bone health status may influence vitamin K‚Äôs effectiveness.

* *Vitamin K Treatment Reduces Undercarboxylated Osteocalcin but
Does Not Alter Bone Turnover, Density, or Geometry in Healthy
Postmenopausal North American Women, 2009:* The Binkley study found no benefit of vitamin K in healthy women with sufficient calcium and vitamin D.

So the North American study (which compared vitamin K1 at 1 mg, MK-4 at 45 mg and placebo) didn't find any actual therapeutic effect on bone density. A quick reading also shows they noted there's a fundamental problem with a study by Sato (who hadn't been disgraced yet in 2009) which strongly influenced a meta-analysis about vitamin K.



Bottom line being: can we even rely on any of the positive studies? And furthermore is there anything scientific to base the MK-4 vs MK-7 debate on?",WhatsUpLabradog,1747089018.0,36,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kl618p/going_down_the_k2_rabbit_hole_does_it_actually_do/

comment,mrzu3e8,1kl618p,11,,,0,"I suspect the problem with these bone mass studies using vitamin D or K2 is that it takes both to build bone mass along with calcium and magnesium. Knowing that the general population tends to run low on many of these makes me think raising one of them doesn't have much impact on bone density. 

Sunlight tends to help bone mass. Melatonin also appears to help bone mass. We do see studies showing K2 increases matrix gla proteins which are the proteins that carry calcium from the blood into bone. We have studies showing vitamin d supplement raises blood calcium levels.

Postmenopausal¬†women have other issues as they are turning over bone too fast. Low estrogen causes an increase in bone resorption.

The main issue is that claims are thrown all of the place by anonymous users with no medical or academic training and no reliable sourcing practices.


For example, while a couple of people here keep repeating that K2 (and specifically MK-7) is a ""soft tissue [i.e. heart, kidneys etc.] and artery decalcifier"", to the point that ""if you feel stinging in your heart it's because the calcium deposits are being removed"", there isn't really much study to support this, to the contrary even. Maybe there are a couple of very small scale studies funded by one of the supplement manufacturers which claim something along these lines, but look at this 2022 study and its 2023 subset study from Denmark, where they tested over 300 participants over 24 months:
https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.057008
https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2023.100643


They basically only found a possible reduction in progression of calcification (but not reversal) compared to placebo in the subgroup that already had the most severe CAC scores >= 400.


A small scale study (48 participants) on dialysis patients found no effect on arterial calcification after 24 months:
https://academic.oup.com/ckj/article/14/9/2114/6122697


And another small scale study (68 participants) found no effect on arterial calcification *and* on bone mineral density in diabetes type 2 patients with cardiovascular history (it was shorter, though, at 6 months):
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33068157/


These were all on the almighty MK-7 form. Does it mean it certainly doesn't help in any situation and has no possible complementary effect when combined with other therapeutic aspects? I don't know, not necessarily. Does it mean MK-4 is certainly better, or otherwise also isn't really effective? I don't know, could be so.

The issue is that lately I began getting strange symptoms like tingles, losing focus mid sentence, feeling that sinking feeling in chest and stomach, overall weird sensations in my muscles, dizziness, fatigue, etc. I was wondering if I am maybe taking too much for too long? Or maybe this is completely unrelated?

Afterwards i experienced a downward spiral in my health and liver /hormone functions . Skin issues neurological stuff , slow motor issues in my hands , muscle jumping face nerves twitching and SEVERE  HYPERACUSIS , Severe anemia that was iron resistant and i began megadosing vitamin c which seemed to help me for a short period and my iron / ferritin came up . Then i added zinc every day about 50-100 mg per day for a while as advised from a nutritionist  because my RBC Zinc was low  ,however i continued because i felt so much improvement . So from October through April   of this year i was taking zinc at that dose give or take, 2000 mg of vitamin C ascorbic acid with periodically megadosing vitamin c /flush because i have high estrogen , my liver is sluggish from the vitamin D overload . thankfully my vitamin D levels just normalized in Jan at 79 . Problem is several weeks ago zinc began making me feel awful and weak and short of breath.  I Never took Vitamin A or Copper during this whole roller coaster and recent came across people talking about how Vitamin D and zinc and resveratrol can cause deficiencies in those .

comment,mrzh2mq,1kl3z8z,7,,,0,"You are probably deficient in copper at those zinc doses. Stop mega-dosing random things, and stick to a mild multi-vitamin for awhile. Your logic behind the mega-doses doesn't even make sense. Vitamin C isn't likely to affect estrogen meaningfully, and Vitamin D toxicity is going to affect your kidneys and heart mostly not your liver.

I don't think you're evaluating these megadoses well at all, and you're just putting your body through a rollercoaster. Get more fruits and vegetables in your diet as well since your electrolytes are probably all over. Don't start megadosing those either.

E: you were basically asking for kidney stones by going into vitamin d toxicity and following it up with vitamin C mega doses. A lot of kidney stones are calcium oxalate. The vitamin D increases your calcium absorption, and the vitamin C produces oxalates.",GrundleBlaster,1747085798.0,,,,

* Ashwghanda KSM-66 (1g)
* Mitoquinol Mesylate (10mg)

MitoQ and NMN are pretty damn expensive ($120/month) but the benefits are worth it imo haha

Was simply curious if anyone had any recommendations to fix/add anything and was just hoping to get thought and opinions? Thanks in advance.

I take DHEA because it is the only thing that works for my severe severe low back pain.  clearly what I need is cortisol but it is very hard to get a doctor to prescribe that.

I have struggled with adrenal exhaustion since my 20s.A Naturopath diagnosed me but alopathic doctors of course don't consider that a legitimate diagnosis.

What caused you this problem is most likely the dose.  
if it's a pill open it up and pour some of the powder into a drink so you get a low dose and slowly increase the amount and see if your issues resolve themselves.

comment,ms1kumk,1kkua5k,1,,,0,"Magnesium pills help 1 person in 20, in the experience of Dr. Garrett Smith. He has a great recipe for topical magnesium you can make yourself.


Look him up on youtube - Nutrition Detective

See livestream video #125 on topical magnesium

The recipe is at 1 hour 30 minutes in, it's called Mag-Ka-Hol


Here is how I make it:


This recipe can be made in a small pitcher (about 2 quarts)

Warm up some clean water and add 1-1/2 cups (357 g) to the pitcher

Add 2 tbsp pharma grade potassium chloride powder (32-33 g) to the pitcher and stir it to dissolve

If necessary, add a little more water to get it dissolved

Add 2 cups (370 g) of pharma grade magnesium chloride powder to the pitcher and stir it to dissolve

(Be careful here because if you packed it into a measuring cup, when you go to dump it in the pitcher it might come out in one big chunk and make a splash)

Add 1 cup (225 g) of 80 proof vodka to the pitcher and stir it

Now it's done, and ready to be transferred to bottles for use

I use condiment bottles with narrow tips


Apply this every day. Pick ONE of these choices for application (this way the dose varies according to your body size):

1. Chest and abdomen, OR

2. Back, from shoulder blades to top of butt, OR

3. All the way around both thighs, from hip to knee 

In addition, apply it to any achy or stiff joints and muscles.

Leave it on for 20 minutes, then you can shower it off.


After six weeks of using this my old injured shoulder freed up on its own and I got full range of motion back. That was a big surprise because I previously spent half a year trying to rehabilitate it (quite painfully) before I gave up. There can be no doubt whatsoever that this stuff gets in and works.


Also see livestream video #160 on copper

Around the 41 minute mark he states that L-Theanine chelates copper and helps with insomnia and anxiety and depression

Around the 50 minute mark he talks about L-Theanine dosing",Several_Prompt2007,1747113677.0,,,,

submission,1kktvrp,,2,"Protein Powder Reviews (Cost, Taste, Macro breakdown)",0.75,,"I‚Äôve found it easier to hit my diet goals through protein powders so pretty much just buy anything that has a slight price decrease on Amazon at the time. Here‚Äôs my reviews 

TLDR: Jym Stoppani‚Äôs Protein Powder is best overall when considering price, Taste, quality 


Jym Protein:

$71 for 45 servings:
$1.57 per serving

Calories: 150
Protein: 24g
Carbohydrates: 6g
Fat: 3g

Whey Isolate: 7.5g
Micellar Casein: 7g
Milk Protein Isolate: 7g
Egg Albumin: 2.5g

I drink this with water and it mixes perfectly in a shaker cup. The taste is easily the best I‚Äôve tried. Vanilla, Chocolate Mousse, and Cookies and Cream are all great flavors 


Ascent Protein Powder:
$67 for 58 servings 
$1.15 per serving 

Calories: 150
Protein: 24g
Carbohydrates: 6g
Fat: 3g

Native Whey Isolate
Whey Isolate
Whey Concentrate 

Didn‚Äôt mix well in shaker cup with water. Taste is probably 3/5. It‚Äôs drinkable but not necessarily enjoyable. 


Ghost Nutter Butter and Oreo

$50 for 26 servings:
$1.92 per serving

Calories: 160
Protein: 26g
Carbohydrates: 6g
Fat: 3g

Whey Isolate 
Native Whey Isolate
Hydrolyzed Whey Isolate 

Mixes well with water in shaker cup. Small pieces of Nutter Butter and Oreo. Taste is above average. Only got because TikTok had a special on price. Probably wouldn‚Äôt buy full price. If you want to add it to your rotation, it‚Äôs great. I wouldn‚Äôt make it my go-to protein drink mainly because of price and something makes me uneasy about adding in Oreos to my diet for no reason 


Gold Standard Fruity Cereal

$37for 29 servings:
$1.27 per serving

(Vanilla has bigger sizes for $1.08 serving)

Calories: 120
Protein: 24g
Carbohydrates: 2g
Fat: 1.5g

Whey Isolate 
Native Whey Isolate
Hydrolyzed Whey Isolate 

Mixes well. I like that it‚Äôs 120 calories so it‚Äôs easier to have 2 scoops end of day if I‚Äôm running lower on calories. Taste is pretty shit. I only got it because I already have a lot of vanilla in other drinks. Its drinkable but It‚Äôs like if you ate cereal with water and it‚Äôs the flavored water a the end of eating cereal, with a bad after taste. I‚Äôd just get vanilla in the future. 

Isopure Vanilla

$88 for 50 servings
($1.76 per serving)
I don‚Äôt remember spending that much at Costco. 

Calories: 100
Protein: 25g
Carbohydrates: 0g
Fat: 0g

Mixes well with water. A lot of complaints on taste. The first time I had it, I thought taste was awful, more salty than sweet. If you drink it knowing it‚Äôs a little salty then it‚Äôs fine. Quick chug, get protein in, no extra macros or fluff

I wouldn‚Äôt buy on Amazon as it‚Äôs expensive compared to other ones. Like I mentioned, I think it‚Äôs cheaper at Costco. it‚Äôs also not 3rd party tested. Im not saying they spike it, but I‚Äôd rather just get a protein that‚Äôs 3rd party tested to ensure ",DDTGGlobal_Analyst,1747060029.0,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kktvrp/protein_powder_reviews_cost_taste_macro_breakdown/

What would you say actually works and that doesn't develop tolerance or whose effect doesn't wear off? What makes you wake up and attain that gist of motivation and energy, and sleep so good that you wake up refreshed?

Is there anything like that or are we to live our lives so dissatisfied and sub-optimal?

P.S. I know therapy is a thing and mind you, I've done 5-6 years of it. I personally didn't feel good enough with them than I did with meds (Buproprion and Atomoxetine) and some supplements (say, Citicoline, Piracetam etc,) and lifestyle changes like daily workouts and low carb high protein diet. It's just that without stimulants like coffee which I have quit (been 41 days), life seems to be a burdensome drag.

comment,mrwv6au,1kkrnhh,9,,,0,"You seem pretty knowledgeable about supplementation so you know how it goes! I think the fact of the matter is that we're constantly comparing ourselves to others and their experiences and everyone is unique in their body chemistry. On one of the forums I frequent, there's a 70 year old guy who is constantly boasting about how great he feels and how great his sex drive and function is, etc. etc. And I think to myself, man good for you, but I also kind of want to punch him the face lol. Point is, regaining vitality is going to be different for each of us, and some of us have additional, insurmountable challenges that others don't have to struggle with. I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Research points into many different areas of dysfunction but we still have zero indication about how to treat it and the supplement game is like playing darts while hanging upside down, blindfolded. That being said, I am currently using quite a few things. Most of them I would put under the category of I don't know if they're helping, but I don't thinking they're hurting, including ALCAR, creatine, small dose of cytomel. The only thing that I'm using that I'd swear on a stack of bibles is effective, is a therapeutic dose of nandrolone prescribed by a men's health clinic for joint pain. It not only helps joint pain, but it has helped my CFS pain tremendously. I'd love to try to give up caffeine again to see if that helps me refresh, but I'm not sure I'd make it through the adjustment period. Best of luck. Keep us updated.",[deleted],1747057680.0,,,,
comment,mrxdv03,1kkrnhh,5,,,0,"I've tried many many supplements and many did nothing but here are the ones that work for me
Magnesium - helps with aches and pains and relaxation plus in used in so many processes our body goes through to keep us well
Vitamin d - got rid of my chronic back pain, some bone pain etc too. Probably also improved my overall wellness too.
L tyrosine - I took this for ADHD and it got rid of my food cravings for 3 months and some ADHD noise. I tend to feel a bit better mentally when I use it but try to cycle it now
Rhodiola root - I took tablets but they didn't work so now I take liquid extract and it always puts me in a better mood makes me feel more calm,  relaxed and mentally boosted 
Glutethione - liquid version gives me attemptory feeling of improved wellness but it only lasts for a few hours
I recently added creatine to my stack and it's early days but it's helped a little with muscle recovery and endurance.

*I have thyroid issues (hypo), ADHD, possibly autism, hypermobility, menopause (made adhd much worse) , insulin resistance, waiting for osteoarthritis diagnosis and possibly eds and a few other undiagnosed illnesses.

*Off track a bit but you many find it helpful. It's not a supplement but I take mounjaro and it got rid of 60% of my chronic pain and fatigue within 2 weeks. I wasn't expecting it and after 20 years of of pain etc, I feel almost normal.
*I also recently realised that it stops my adhd noise to such an extent that my mind is so quiet now. I'm so used to rushing, doing things last minute and relying on dopamine so it feels weird to not have that.

My fast starts at 8-9pm and I usually end it around when I I get home the next day around 2:30-3pm.  I would take it after work before my weight training but I like to eat before weight since I‚Äôm already fasting all day and I know eating will raise my insulin and negate the fat burning qualities of it so I would rather not waste it then. So my question is if I take it in the morning before work would I reap the benefits or would my activity not be enough to benefit from it? Because I read the thermogenics of yohimbine isn‚Äôt really enough for the fat burning but I‚Äôm still unsure.

I've been using it for probably a decade now. Creatine doesn't agree with me, so I really hunted for another supplement I feel actually helps me, and along with caffeine, citrulline malate really helps with my stamina in the gym.

As for omega 3, i buy two supplements. Omega flax oil, which used to be packaged in nitrogen. Maybe still. And hempseed oil which has sda and gla as bonus features. I buy small bottles. I think they are about 13 ounces. And I keep them in the freezer. When i want to grab a serving of oil, i take it out, and after half an hour, there's enough thawed out to pour. It can be used in omelets or other recipies. 

I've also mixed flax oil with a pound of butter. That makes it spreadable from the fridge. And that butter can also be used for egg recipies or on vegetables. 

When using flax seeds, I rinse them in a screen strainer with hot water to remove the film of rancid oil that is always there. Then they get put into a recipe. I used to eat them separately for the oil and everything else. So after rinsing, I'd add water and boil it in the microwave. That destroys the seed's enzyme inhibiters that inhibit digestion.

I have been taking 400mg of magnesium glycinate daily for a long time, and never felt any benefits. I've been having a slew of health symptoms. For context, I'm a 21 year old male. I started to have the mental health stuff: anxiety, poor mood, irritation, extreme brain fog, difficulty concentrating, struggling to find words. Than the physical stuff started to pop up too: extreme fatigue despite getting 8+ hours of sleep, restless leg syndrome, acne, low libido, shortness of breath, heart palpations, low blood pressure.

  
For extra context, for like 4-5 months I was living the healthiest I ever had. Eating whole foods like liver, chicken, sardines, oysters, spinach, various fruits, kefir, sweet potatoes, you name it. I had it. I worked out, walked a lot, I even did meditation, No sugar, no caffeine, no blue light before bed, tried various skin care products far and few in between, no products, korean skincare, nothing worked. 

I am starting to heavily believe I have an autoimmune condition, or something. I decided to up my dosage of magnesium glycinate for a short period of time to 600-800mg, I legit took it with 300mg of L-theanine the other night and bam my heart palpations have basically gone away. I'm going to be getting blood work done soon, but I'm expecting to hear I'm also deficient in zinc, iron/ferritin. Hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, thyroid are fine.

I'm questioning, is it possible if I was really low on magnesium that 400mg was not enough to bring me back out the depths of IBS/celiac hell?

Beyond taking calcium and vitamin D3, she was prescribed in the past a couple of those standard medications that are proven to somewhat help but tend to have many side-effects. She decided not to keep with those.

I read about the relation between calcium, vitamin D, magnesium and vitamin K. She remembers one doctor mentioning magnesium but not actually testing for it, and no doctor has mentioned vitamin K.

So I've been looking around and it seems there are some studies that have shown merit for supplementing with vitamin K for osteoporotic or otherwise postmenopausal women. I saw mentions of ""the Japanese study"", so I found one from 2000 (Shiraki) which used 45 mg/day/2 years for osteoporotic women and found improvement in their lumber bone density and fracture incidence, and another from 2013 (Koitaya) which used 1.5 mg/day/1 year for postmenopausal women and found improvement in their forearm density.

Now, both of these involved **K2 MK-4**, which to my understanding is the actual form used metabolically by the body. There is also the MK-7 form, which some people claim is more effective due to a longer half-life but I saw many complain it gave them palpitations and other symptoms, so I'm reluctant to recommend this specific form.

Another point is that the vast majority of MK-4 supplements on the market are MUCH smaller dose. There are a couple I found that have 5 mg tablets, and just one (Peak K2 by AOR) that has 15 mg capsules. **EDIT:** Now I also found Life Extension's Mega Vitamin K2 which has 45 mg per capsule.

So I wanted to know whether there is more scientific literature on using such doses, because (outside of Japan at least) it seems really uncommon. One site which markets supplements (possible conflict of interest) claims it doesn't promote excessive blood clotting because past the baseline ~60 mcg intake *""once low doses activate coagulation proteins in the liver, then no matter how much more vitamin K is ingested, there is no excess coagulation/clotting risk. That‚Äôs because when coagulation proteins are fully saturated with vitamin K, they cannot take up more vitamin K to cause greater coagulation potential""*. It is worth noting she is not on blood thinners, although some other routine medications are taken.

I'm still not confident I found enough credible information about it.

So, what other studies do we have available in 2025?",WhatsUpLabradog,1746996502.0,34,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kkaz11/megadozing_on_vitamin_k2_mk4_any_recent_study_on/

comment,mrvmdr7,1kkaz11,6,,,0,"One thing to take into consideration is those studies from Japan are not reliable...

https://www.science.org/content/article/researcher-center-epic-fraud-remains-enigma-those-who-exposed-him

Yoshihiro Sato , the guy behind a lot of those studies was found to have lied and probably killed himself out of shame.

The thinking is that he faked a lot of research to sell K2 as the next big supplement, kind of like what David Sinclair did with resveratrol.

That does not mean K2 is worthless, just that we should not rely on those studies. They did use a big dose, 45mg. Thorne makes a liquid K2-MK4 that has this dosage. The bottle they sell is $80 but lasts a while. I bought it and only use a little each day.

I also take 100mcg of MK7 and try to eat a lot of greens for K1. I think this is probably the best way to cover all your bases.",I-Lyke-Shicken,1747035421.0,,,,
comment,mrtqa8e,1kkaz11,2,,,0,">the vast majority of MK-4 supplements on the market are MUCH smaller dose.

No, they are much bigger. MK-4 is mg, MK-7 is mcg. I take 2-300 mcg MK-7 what is less than 1% of 5 mg Mk-4.",VirtualMoneyLover,1747004404.0,,,,
comment,msii59z,1kkaz11,2,,,0,"I'm seeing some anti-MK-7 comments here, so I'll provide a gentle rebuttal to balance out the conversation. MK-7 has both a better initial absorption rate and a longer half life in the blood stream. While some have theorized MK-7 sticks around longer because it's not well absorbed by tissues, there is meaningful evidence to contradict this. Specifically, studies show that no matter how you slice it MK-7 has more evidence for supporting bone health. Namely, that MK-7 can have superior effect in activating osteocalcin, and overall, has a stronger clinical pedigree for supporting bone mineralization/over health.

Here's some studies reflecting that:

* **Schurgers et al., 2007**: MK-7 achieved **higher extrahepatic vitamin K activity**, indicated by greater carboxylation of osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein, compared to MK-4.
* **Booth et al., 2014 (review)**: Acknowledged the slower tissue uptake of MK-7 but emphasized its **clinical efficacy** in improving biomarkers of bone and cardiovascular health.

The argument is that the longer blood retention time of MK-7 is not a bug but a feature. By being available for much longer time (up to 72hrs vs 2hrs with MK-4!), MK-7 can have a more potent effect. The proof is the superior effect on bone health markers, as shown in clinical studies.

Lastly, I do supplement with K2 (75mcg daily) and personally use a ""mixed menaquinone"" product that contains MK-4 through MK-10 (so includes MK-7). In your situation, Now, Jarrow and Life Extension all make higher strength K product that contain K1, MK-4 and MK-7. As long as blood thinners or related concerns aren't in the mix, this would probably be a good starting point.

I actually don't have a super strong opinion on all this, but ""MK-7 is bullshit"" comments are about as high quality as they appear to be. I'm also under the impression that it's agreed MK-4 is the body's preferred form for normal metabolic function, but that's not what we're talking about here.

Edit: wanted to add a bit about the impact on coagulation. Yes, as far as I know, it is accurate to say K will not contribute to excessive clotting. There are only so many clotting factors to activate, once those are active, K can't have additional influence on clotting. While it's always preferred to have more evidence, it seem reasonable that if this was a concern, it would have shown up in the numerous studies done around the world as a key safety concern.",Substantial-Type5566,1747341787.0,,,,

15 mg still sounds a lot even if there were studies (with a at least one being fraudulent as mentioned around here) using 45 mg, and I actually would have preferred to find an MK-4 supplement that has maybe 5 mg and recommend her to take a dose in the morning and a dose in the evening (to maintain a heightened blood level for more than just a couple of hours [as per reports on MK-4's short circulation half-life] and without going to such singular ""megadozes""), but it was either much smaller amounts or 15/45 mg capsules. I guess another option is the open the capsule and sprinkle its content on some snack that can be eaten throughout the day, but this is more difficult to follow consistently.


Now, most studies, whether they found significant benefits (many of those are funded) or none/insignificant ones, didn't mention serious side effects, but there were also a couple of studies done on type 2 diabetics with cardiovascular disease history and on hypercholesterolemic mice and both found detrimental side effects. On the diabetics they used MK-7 and found it might've slightly increased active femoral arterial calcification, and on the mice they used MK-4 and found it increased blood LDL, lipids and liver fat, plus there were markers for liver fibrosis although the livers didn't seem scarred *yet* at time of dissection.

comment,mrtmhpg,1kk6vao,3,,,2,"Certainly. Vitamin D3 can be a huge factor on choosing the right brand as it can make a real difference in how your body absorbs and essentially ""handles"" the nutrient. It‚Äôs not really just about getting the vitamin D3 into our systems. It‚Äôs also about what comes along with it and how it affects our mineral balance of humans over time.

Studies, including my own.. cheaper brands often use low quality oils, fillers, and even preservatives, that can cause inflammation or cause a disruption on how our body processes other nutrients like calcium, magnesium or zinc. Some additives can also bind to certain minerals in our gut and can play a part, essentially disrupting absorption. 

Another major issue is how D3 impacts calcium. Without the right balance of vitamin K2, especially the MK 7 form, D3 can lead to calcium being deposited in places you don‚Äôt want.. like arteries or soft tissue for example.. instead of strengthening bones (which is one of the main purposes) This can create long term problems, especially if you‚Äôre not getting enough magnesium, which is essential for activating both D3 and K2. Also the average human lacks magnesium in the common diet due to poor soil health. Poor soil health contributes to how much magnesium our vegetables have. No way to know how the veggies we get from the local grocery store are grown.

There‚Äôs also a question of whether the product contains what the label claims on pretty much everything but some lower end brands skip rigorous testing, so you could be getting more or less than what‚Äôs listed, which plays a large role on how safe and effective the supplement really is. On top of that the delivery method matters too. Sprays or drops with clean and stable oil arre often absorbed much more efficiently and place less stress on the digestive system.

""Mineral corruption"" as you state would mean thatt the large imbalances that could potentially happen when D3 is taken without the right co-factors, such as a poorly formulated product.. or in a way that disrupts your body‚Äôs natural nutrient rhythm. This is why choosing a high quality, well tested brand important.",iKoshibo,1747002988.0,,,,

comment,mrs0llg,1kk3417,2,,,2,"The tingling really is not that bad. You can lessen it by spreading the dose out over the day and taking it with food. It takes a while to build up in your system so the effects are not immediate anyways.

Boron should be cycled every few weeks. I personally take it for a month and cycle off for a bit. I have no issues with it. 

Zinc is safe,it can cause low copper levels over time but if you eat a varied diet with fruits and veggies, it is probably not an issue. 50mg a day for a few months is safe. I personally consume cocoa powder which is a great source of copper.

I like CM and beetroot. Combined with taurine and some coffee, that is usually my pre-workout mix. Not all beetroot powders are good. I find the cheaper generic ones don't do much.

as for acute recovery? eh, i mean, the only thing to be aware of is the greater water retention from creatine, which may be good or bad depending on other conditions. so if you take it just make sure you drink plenty of water.

either way, while it may not be a miracle curative, it very likely won't *hurt* and might have other benefits only tangentially related to recovery, and daily supplementing of creatine would likely be good for many people, regardless of their immediate issues",JackDostoevsky,1746974791.0,,,,

This might work best for you it is what I do and works the best for me 

Firstly I make sure to get all the vitamins and minerals(Essential) ones 

I take 2 mg of fish per day of Which at least 800mg are Epa and dha they are best for reducing pain

I take boron glycine 6mg per day alongside magnesium glycinate 200-300mg per day 

Also make sure you get enough calcium with vit d3 for example I take 4000iu vit d3 with 100uq vit k2 very important if you take vit d3

And mostly I eat lots of protein 1.6g per kg of bodyweight 

And finally I take collagen 10mg per day that has type 1 2 3 5 and 10 collagen in it 

Most important when you will be able to do rehab exercises and sleep well 8 hours per night

At first I had good effects but then I noticed concerning side effects. I often get side effects even from the most innocent supplements and herbs but those were really infuriating. And once I stopped they never reversed!

One was a headache in a very specific part of my head or sinuses. Another was that ever since I've had incontinence - I need to pee a lot more often than before. I read some studies that boron can be toxic to the kidneys but I never went above the safe dosage. Still, knowing I overreact to even small doses of supps I haven't touched it since but I often get bouts of neuralgic pain in my sinuses/head I didn't get before I started on it. And I feel like it overtaxed my kidneys as never before I need to go to the WC so often. It's like I'm showing signs of dehydration while drinking normal amounts of water and yet having to pee like mad. I drink one small cup and 30-40 minutes later I have to pee and then 20 minutes later again.

TMI but not only that but while my testes were fuller and heavier on boron once I stopped they shrank to a size, smaller than my original size. I feel like boron made my androgen receptors as I miss the confidence but it wrecked me

Worst of all is I got ED when I stopped! I now almost feel chemically castrated as I can't get in the mood as easily as before. I rarely get a morning boner, whereas before boron I got them every single morning! I never had problems before with getting or maintaining an E either. It seems boron has ruined my HPA axis as well as my sexual health, so how can I detox? I haven't used any other supplements or herbs when on boron or around that time.

comment,mruplu5,1kjzdfy,2,,,2,"There may be an underlying physiological problem unrelated to boron. You may have already ruled that out, idk, but your post seemed to zero in on boron as the culprit  prematurely. It seems far more likely that what you‚Äôre describing is indicative of an undiagnosed condition or disease. That happens to people every day. Getting permanently poisoned by a low dose of an extremely safe mineral taken a year ago seems far less probable. Just my two cents. 


Also, in my humble opinion, it would be wise not to assume that all of the symptoms you described are related and caused by the same thing. There could well be two independent causes that account for all of the symptoms you listed. Like, maybe you did have a bad reaction to boron and it caused the acute pain in your head, but you‚Äôre also deficient in zinc or vitamin d or unknowingly have a metabolic disorder or circulatory system problem. Something could be interfering with testosterone and dht production, thereby reducing libido, drive, and motivation, and the boron is responsible for the acute head pain and that‚Äôs it. 

The body alone is impossibly complex, so many dynamic processes at play that your safe supplementation of a pretty forgiving mineral a long time ago causing all of the things you mentioned seems improbably simplistic. I‚Äôd look for possible alternative causes, but that‚Äôs just me. 


Some things you could try that are over the counter are tribulus or tongkat for a very short period of time, a trial period only. Tongkat definitely needs to be cycled. Those might help if it‚Äôs testosterone or LH related. But be careful.",drunkthrowwaay,1747018084.0,,,,

You can absolutely take these supplements together with some smart timing and the correct food choices!
In the morning, take some vitamin D3 with a meal that has healthy fat like avocado or eggs. If you‚Äôre using L-theanine for focus, take it then too. You can take it either alone or with coffee. They actually work pretty well together from my studies and personal experience.

Omega 3 is best with lunch or dinner that includes some fat for proper absorption. Turmeric curcumin with BioPerine also pairs well with a fatty meal later in the day.

In the evening, using magnesium glycinate, as it is known for helping with relaxation and sleep. If you use L theanine for calming, this is a good time for a second dose. Raspberry leaf works well as an afternoon or evening tea and doesn‚Äôt need food with it. 

And for brands i would totally suggest Bare Biology or Nordic Naturals for the omega 3. If you want plant based omega 3 from algae. (Could be more gentle and easier to absorb as some individuals dont do well with fish oil. Id go nutritional roots.

For turmeric curcumin, look at New Chapter or Gaia Herbs. They‚Äôre organic, well tested, and provide BioPerine.

comment,mrpc1ze,1kjslkd,1,,,0,"I hate to break it to you, ¬†but caffeine is a drug, ¬†and a stimulant to be exact. ¬† Putting my smartass comment aside: ¬†¬†

One possibility is that you‚Äôre just getting older and noticing the side effects of too much caffeine. ¬†¬†I used to live on coffee too, ¬† worked well for me up until my late 30‚Äôs then came the change in effect. ¬† ¬†Still works well as long as I limit it to a cup or two in the AM. ¬†¬†

A second possibility is that that amount of caffeine daily caused you to deplete some key nutrients. ¬† ¬† Don‚Äôt forget that caffeine is a diuretic, ¬†and can cause nutrient loss (mainly calcium, ¬†magnesium, ¬†potassium, and b-vitamins) through urination. ¬†

So I‚Äôd try a good b-complex (with the correct forms), ¬† as well as some magnesium, ¬†potassium, ¬†and d3/k2 as well. ¬† ¬†The d3/k2 should help you absorb more calcium to replace what you lost, ¬†don‚Äôt supplement calcium. ¬† ¬†

And cut back on the coffee, ¬†that much just isn‚Äôt healthy. ¬†A quality b-complex, ¬†taken a couple times a week, ¬†should give you more good energy than caffeine ever could. ¬†",AccomplishedNet7223,1746939725.0,,,,

You have such an interesting take like maybe because of my aging or maybe my tolerance levels decreased or maybe because of 60 capsules of D3 each of 2400 IU in short span of time changed this or maybe because of 1 capsule of Lions mane mushroom complex  I took before all of this happened I don‚Äôt know. 

But as you suggested I feel like I need to take B-complex supplements added to the fact that it worked for lot of people here. I feel like I need to go with methylated B-complex.

As for forms, ¬†I‚Äôd recommend magnesium malate and citrate. ¬† Malate works best for day use and citrate for evening, ¬†I‚Äôd stay away from magnesium glycinate as it can cause issues other forms don‚Äôt. ¬† ¬†

For potassium, ¬†citrate is the best absorbed and gives you the most elemental potassium per dose. ¬† But it can have a mild diuretic effect, ¬†as it‚Äôs also used for preventing and treating kidney stones. ¬† ¬†Potassium gluconate is worth considering if you don‚Äôt want that effect, ¬†but I did find citrate more effective overall.

submission,1kjrrlc,,1,Forskolin Reaction,0.6,,"Hello all, long time on and off sufferer of anxiety issues. Every time I took fish oil my symptoms would get worse, more agitation, more headaches ect. Upon searching, I see that It‚Äôs a result of high acetylcholine. I decided to try out life extensions forskolin, as it reduces acetylcholine and raises dopamine. So a few weeks ago the first time I took it, I felt amazing and it reduced my inflammation and got rid of my headaches and neck pain. Second day I started to feel anxious so I stopped it for a day and took it for a third and last time. I had a full panic attack and anxiousness on and off for a week after. The good it‚Äôs left me with is reduction in pain and inflammation. 

The weird thing from all this is I have been taking magnesium glycinate for at least four years now and always at bedtime with good results for relaxation and sleep. On day two of taking forskolin, when I went to take my bedtime magnesium it gave me the opposite effect, I got energized and awake. I thought it must have been from the forskolin. Then I took only magnesium once more a few days later before bedtime and it caused the same exact result, I was unable to sleep. I stopped everything for a week but the anxiety was bothering me, so I started taking the magnesium again but only in the afternoon and before evening, it greatly reduced my anxiety and is what‚Äôs saving me till now, but now seems to give me energy instead of sleep. Can anyone explain this to me please? and what it means happened or is happening  ? 

Note that I also learned a lot of knowledge through a fellow redditer about genes and methylation. I ordered a gene test and waiting on that to arrive, hopefully to try methylated route once I get results",fixbrains,1746934518.0,10,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kjrrlc/forskolin_reaction/

comment,mrpwora,1kjrrlc,1,,,0,"Seems like forskolin could of thrown off your brain chemistry by raising dopamine and lowering acetylcholine. Could potentially be why magnesium flipped and started feeling more activating than calming.

Getting a gene test is a smart move. If you‚Äôve got slower dopamine breakdown (like COMT variants) or methylation issues (MTHFR), it could make you more reactive to changes like this.

comment,mrq0pos,1kjrrlc,3,,,2,"Well, I have studied this a bit. Heres a break down of what can help you understand. 

A few people that feel great at first including clearer focus, and less inflammation. But knowing your system is already sensitive, it may quickly push things too far and cause that feeling of anxiety or overstimulation. That shift in brain chemistry can also change how your body reacts to other supplements, like magnesium. 

One of the most relevant genes here is COMT, which helps break down dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. If you carry a slower version of this gene.. like the Val158Met variant, itt means you naturally clear these stimulating neurotransmitters much more slowly. When forskolin raises dopamine, your system can become overloaded at a rampant rate.. Leading to the kind of anxious, agitated state you described. That could also explain why magnesium started to feel morr active. Inside of you it was being processed in an entirely different neurochemical environment then before. 

MAOA is another key gene to consider. It‚Äôs known to be involved in breaking down both dopamine and serotonin. Some people that have a lower activity version of MAOA may actually be more prone to emotional sensitivity.. especially under stress or with sudden shifts in brain chemistry. Forskolin may have amplified this, leaving your system in a heightened, less stable state.

Variants like C677T or A1298C can impair these processes, making it harder for your system to understand when something like forskolin comes in and changes the balance. 

MTHFR, which affects folate metabolism and methylation, plays a significant role in how well your body supports neurotransmitter balance and detox. 

The GAD1 gene is also important because it helps convert glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, into GABA, which is¬† generally calming. If that pathway is sluggish or underperforming, it could explain why magnesium.. which is also often used to support GABA.. started making you feel stimulated insteaf. Your GABA system may have been too imbalanced to process it normally. 

And.. Finally, CACNA1C is a calcium channel gene linked to neural excitability. Some variants make the nervous system more reactive to changes in intracellular signaling. That might have made you more sensitive to the effects of forskolin on your NMDA receptors or calcium dynamics, tipping your system into a more reactive state overall. 

With all these genes, they can form a kind of map of how your body processes stimulation, stress, and neurotransmitters.

When forskolin changed your terrain, your system may not have had the flexibility to adapt smoothly. Once you get your gene test back, re reading this, you‚Äôll likely understand how these patterns support your brain chemistry going forward.",iKoshibo,1746954471.0,,,,

comment,mrppcs5,1kjrh5e,1,,,0,"Hmm..
A lot, if not all the studies I have ever read, creatine isn‚Äôt likely to cause muscle cramps or dehydration, and in some cases, it possibly could even help reduce them. With that being said, some people still run into cramping.. especially if they're more active than usual or their hydration and mineral levels are off. Everyone reacts a little differently. (Obviously) lol

Since you‚Äôve experienced cramps while using creatine, it might be due to when you're taking it, like in the evening. Not having enough electrolytes, or pushing your body harder without enough recovery. You could try moving your dose earlier in the day, drinking more fluids, and making sure you‚Äôre getting minerals like magnesium and potassium.

If it still persists, it could help to check for underlying issues. Important tests like an electrolyte panel, magnesium (preferably RBC), vitamin D and calcium, kidney function, creatine kinase (CK) and a thyroid panel. These will help identify imbalances or stress in the body that may be contributing to the cramps.

* I never felt anything else besides being able to do 10-20% more reps at my max safe weight, as in going from 8 to 10 reps. I don't see any use for it outside of getting more training resistance, I definitely never felt any nootropic effect or the like (I did feel it from other things like acetyl l-carnitine though). And I think the alleged increased body weight is explained by the water retention side effect and not by any actual lean mass increase.

* Back then it was cycled for at least 1-3 months on / 1-3 months off, it was considered unsafe for permanent consumption because the theory was that your body might start to make less natural creatine if you are permanently on. I'm not sure of this because I never did it for more than 1 month straight and I only took it on training days, but people who are now permanently on might want to do periodic blood testing for at least their creatinine level

* The readily bioavailable forms like ethyl ester don't need a loading phase, it's like taking pre-workout, you don't need to take it if you don't train that day. I took it 4 hours before working out and it worked for me and better than my gymbros who were on monohydrate.

Some countries which regulate supplements say b6 needs to be below 21mg down to 10mg max daily.¬† To be safe stay under 10mg or less.

""UL of 12‚Äâmg/day is established by the Panel for vitamin B6 for adults (including pregnant and lactating women""

Australia: The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has updated regulations to require a warning about peripheral neuropathy for products containing more than 10 mg of vitamin B6 daily.¬†

Netherlands: As of October 1, 2018, dietary supplements may not contain more than 21 mg of vitamin B6 daily. This change was made to reduce the risk of harmful health effects associated with high doses of vitamin B6, such as neuropathy.",eezyduzit,1746940098.0,,,,

There are also other purposes for taking melatonin. I've been taking 1-6 grams of melatonin for chronic fatigue for about three years. My average dose was 1.5g and recently I raised it to 3g. Doris Loh advocates for 4g split throughout the day and taken every two hours for longevity and healthy aging. This is all to say it's incredibly safe so you won't hurt yourself.

Most (around 95%) of the melatonin you take is used up by the mitochondria.  Pineal melatonin is only a small amount of the total. If you take it for non sleep it does help with immunity, inflammation, mitochondrial health etc.",Optimal_Assist_9882,1746958544.0,,,,
comment,mrsnpba,1kjqs6p,2,,,0,"I have always slept better by working on my circadian rhythm. We get tired at 90 minute intervals, melatonin alone has never been enough, not even close. Melatonin alone will just give me drowsiness, but other chemicals like adenosine and a blunting of noradrenaline and cortisol are essential for sleeping properly, it just doesn't make much sense to me to use melatonin unless it's an emergency, at which point I use melatonin and ashwaganda+chamomile to also blunt the stress hormones.

For me it suffices to maintain some consistency in bedtime and more importantly exposure to outdoor light when I wake up/during the day, followed by wearing blue light blocking glasses in the evening, and maintaining a predictable pattern/routine because the subconscious hormonally responds to other sensory cues to facilitate sleep.

I get consistent 90-100 sleep score and I use stimulants, I've never gotten such good consistent sleep in my life, being mindful of lighting seems to be like 70% of it, I'll get so tired I won't even have the ability to ruminate or break this cycle.",iLoveReductions,1746991237.0,,,,

comment,mrs9mmn,1kjqs6p,1,,,0,"I think this from MB Anderson's bio on healthunlocked is worth a read:

*My comments are for those newly diagnosed or just beginning their research.*  
  
*When most of us are newly diagnosed, we go through denial, anger, sometimes depression, grief, eventually growth, and finally acceptance. When we reach acceptance, we find that Parkinson‚Äôs is not as bad as we imagined. It‚Äôs not a death sentence, it‚Äôs a wakeup call.*  
  
*My takeaway from the doctor visit when I was told I have Parkinson‚Äôs was, ‚ÄòThere is no cure, there‚Äôs nothing to be done‚Äô and because I didn‚Äôt want it to take over and dominate my life, I went about my business, taking no action, which was a huge mistake. There is much we can do and the sooner we start, the better.*  
  
*If, when I were newly diagnosed, I knew then what I know now, I believe I would be leading a normal life.  This, because of changes I would have made to my lifestyle, diet, and exercise regime.*  
  
*In summary, there are no Parkinson‚Äôs (PD) pharmaceuticals which effect the underlying disease, that is, slow, stop, or reverse the progression. They only provide some relief from some symptoms a few hours at a time and often with disturbing side effects, so our first and most important decision is whether to take PD pharmaceuticals at the time of diagnosis or when our symptoms interfere with the quality of our life.  There is not consensus on this.*  
  
*Most people with Parkinson‚Äôs (PWP) within a few years after diagnosis take prescribed Parkinson‚Äôs pharmaceuticals, consider them essential and are well served by them. While I am supportive of other‚Äôs decision to take prescriptions, I‚Äôve decided to delay taking drugs for as long as possible.*  
  
*Parkinson‚Äôs causes other illnesses, sleep disturbance, nutritional deficiencies, hormonal, enzyme, and micro-biome imbalances, and as these conditions accumulate and worsen, they cause the progression to accelerate which worsens these conditions creating a negative feedback loop, but when these conditions are identified through testing and corrected through intervention, symptoms can be slowed, often significantly. If these other health issues are resolved and then combined with certain lifestyle changes, the progression can be slowed down substantially in many people.*  
  
*There are many knowledgeable people contributing to this forum and there are hundreds of links referencing the studies supporting their comments. The best way to use this site is to type keywords in the search window or click on the ‚Äúfollow‚Äù this discussion link below the posts you are researching because nearly every question has already been discussed several times and some discussions are more thorough than others.*  
  
*In the course of doing research, you will run across health gurus, doctors and pwp who claim a proprietary knowledge and protocols that are relatively effective.*    
  
*Here are 4 truths;*  
  
*1.*	*There are no doctors or health gurus who get everything right.*   
*2.*	*There are conflicting data on every subject, drug & supplement.*  
*3.*	*Out of thousands of drugs tested in vivo, in vitro, in mice, fruit flies, worms or in all other animals and people over the past 30 years, not one has proved disease modifying.*    
*4.*	*We are all different and therefore what works for one person will not work for everyone.  That means we all must go through a lot of trial and error to find the best regimen, diet, & supplements that work for ourselves.......*",alexduckkeeper_70,1746986600.0,,,,

No supplement is going to really do much unless you count supplementing whey protein to hit bigger protein macro ratios in your food intake. Don‚Äôt worry about all that stuff about timing it right after workout - your body doesn‚Äôt build muscle instantly. You just need to eat enough protein and calories on a daily basis to make sure you‚Äôre going to gain mass at all. It‚Äôll feel good to eat something after a workout though. 

Creatine helps you perform better, and if it helps you push harder and recover faster you will probably make more progress. 

If you count lots of excess testosterone as a supplement then doing T and busting your ass will make you ripped for sure. Non-anabolic supplements just can‚Äôt do anything to your testosterone levels to any really big degree.

comment,mrps8nf,1kjhkw6,2,,,0,"Hey bud, I have some friendly advice that could help you quite a bit. You may benefit from incorporating glycine into your nighttime routine. Taking 3 grams about 30 minutes before bed can help lower core body temperature, calming the nervous system, and also promoting deeper sleep. I'd use thorne or bulk supplements for this. (Even tho people say thorne has dropped in quality, I haven't seen proof) anyways..

Apigenin is also super helpful. Epecially for anxiety related sleep issues. This calming flavonoid, found in chamomile, supports GABA activity and reduces cortisol levels. A dosage of 25 to 50 mg taken around 45 minutes before bed is effective.  Brands like Double Wood and Toniiq is a good go 2 for this. It's recommended to cycle this.. 3 weeks on, 1 week off. Or if it helps you and don't want that long of a break, you could do 5 days on, 2 days off. 

Holy basil(tulsi) is a very gentle adaptogen that can be taken with dinner or as tea after your evening meal to support cortisol balance and emotional stability. It‚Äôs well suited for those experiencing chronic stress. A high quality option like Gaia Herbs would be a solid choice.

Magnolia bark, typically taken in doses of 100 to 200 mg about 30 minutes before sleep, is especially useful for those who wake up during the night due to stress. It lowers cortisol and promotes restful sleep without causing nextt day grogginess. Harmonic Arts Magnolia Bark Powder is super good.

And... lastly. I would like to suggest tart cherry juice as it can naturally boost melatonin and support a healthy sleep/wake rhythm. I'd suggest taking 1 to 2 ounces about an hour before bed as it may help enhance sleep depth and duration. Lakewood Organic is super clean. I'd use this.

Something to keep in mind, while all of these have no known serious interactions I would strongly suggest introducing them gradually. Like.. one every few days. Using the lowest effective doses. Especially at night to avoid the morning grogginess.

Side note: Acupuncture helped me more then any supplement ever has. Can help with almost everything it seems like. Something to keep in mind!

Taking both together is fine, if the proper ratio is honored. Something like 20:1 zinc to copper should work well.

There is no need to take any metal supplement on a continual daily basis. Metals do bio-accumulate in the body and excess can develop over time. It's best to take a week break, or so, on occasion with any metal supplement.

Also you should ensure you are not protein-deficient, as certain amino acids are required for your body to transport metals. One of the most important metal chaperone molecules is metallothionein (MT). The important amino acids for this molecule are: cysteine, methionine, lysine, and serine. Any weightlifting protein powder should cover all your bases. If you are deficient, it could be a double whammy: Your body might be unable to adequately absorb/use the metals you are supplementing, and it could also be unable to properly excrete excess metals if you've over-supplemented.",intralth,1747036981.0,,,,

submission,1kjcf65,,0,Advice on current stack,0.4,,"Hello, recently started caring about my health and supplementing slowly.

My current stack is: (I have ADHD, and take Vyvanse 50mg)

**1. L-Tyrosine 500mg in the morning with Vyvanse**

**2. Vitamin D3 5,000 IU (I don't get any sun whatsoever.)**

**3. Vitamin B complex (b6 is at 20mg) 3-4x a week.**

**4. Magnesium Glycinate (pure) (at night) 240mg.**

I take these every time I supplement currently.

I have also purchased:

**A. Lions Mane 500mg (1/3% full flowering plant) pills.**

**B. Rhodiola Rosea 250mg**

**C. Ubiquinol CoQ10 100mg**¬†

Can I incorporate this well? My objective is overall long term health. The Rhodiola is supposedly a good stimulant to add to your stack with Vyvanse, and to reduce anxiety from them. The Lion's Mane I heard amazing things about but I don't know if it's enough and it is a pill, is that effective? The Ubiquinol I heard is amazing for your heart, my sister died of Heart Disease and I am currently obese. I haven't opened any of these and decided to ask for help before doing so.

I just had a daughter and I want to be alive for her as long as I can. And myself, now that I'm happier.

I'm 33, 5'11 and 270lbs if matters. (I'm working on the weight.) My diet consists of a lot of meat/protein products (not excessive, just meat almost every meal, except breakfast.) Generally: beef, chicken, turkey.

The more general principle here is that ALA, NAC, and EGcG are general chelators of all minerals. So if you supplement with any of those three, you should expect some reduction over time in all your minerals: magnesium, copper, zinc, iron, boron, etc. Therefore, you should either limit the amounts of these three chelators you ingest, or you should increase the amount of all those minerals you take, to compensate for the chelating effect.

I do use sleep aids occasionally because I‚Äôm a former night shifter.  though so idk if that helps‚Äî so really my goal possibly is to just go off of caffeine for a couple weeks and see how it goes but it‚Äôs been probably close to two decades or so since I‚Äôve not had caffeine in my body.

Chat gpt did bring this up that I found helpful and why I loved to a 10am cutoff versus 1-2pm

Quarter-Life of Caffeine
	‚Ä¢	The half-life of caffeine is typically around 5‚Äì6 hours (though it varies by individual).
	‚Ä¢	That means in 5‚Äì6 hours, half the caffeine is gone.
	‚Ä¢	The quarter-life is how long it takes for 75% of the caffeine to be cleared ‚Äî and 25% to still remain in your system.

So, if you consume 100 mg of caffeine at 8:00 AM:
	‚Ä¢	By ~2:00 PM: 50 mg remains (half-life).
	‚Ä¢	By ~8:00 PM: 25 mg remains (quarter-life).
	‚Ä¢	By ~2:00 AM: 12.5 mg remains.

Even that remaining 25 mg (at night) can:
	‚Ä¢	Disrupt deep sleep (especially slow-wave sleep).

my local costco had two protein supplements for sale: the USN Blue Labs Whey Protein (2kg) and the USN Muscle Fuel Anabolic (2.2kg). 

naturally i gravitated towards the 2.2kg (and the fact it's cheaper and more protein content) but I realised that both had some differences aside the protein and weight content: 

- the muscle fuel anabolic is higher in calories and contains creatine which I'm already taking separately
- the whey protein doesn't seem to have creatine listed in the ingredients 

and from what I've read somewhere that whey is better for losing weight whilst the muscle fuel is more catered towards those naturally slimmer and to put on weight/ muscles. 

for context I'm a bit overweight and don't have a slim build so my goal is to mainly lose weight (through exercise, diet, cal deficit and other things) as well as tone up and gain muscle - would the whey protein be the better choice?

I don't know if it has something to do with the China tariff thing, but one of the few *somewhat* affordable wheys remaining for me post-COVID as a non-US resident was Lake Avenue, and its iHerb pricing history went like this: it used to cost ~$40 around 2022, it later climbed to $60-$70 which was the price until recently, and now I looked and it cost more than $90! And it is not even super-concentrated as it's a ""probiotic blend"" of sort, but I do like that iHerb publish lab tests for it.

Now being so expensive it is even more unworthwhile for me as there is a certain import tax threshold in my country which is surpassed at this price point. No one will buy 5 pounds of whey blend for ~$110.

I see this specific brand is currently available to US customers on Amazon for $50-something, but it doesn't have a lot of sales there. Why would you more than double a product's price within 2-3 years when it's sure to severely harm sales?

comment,mrntl56,1kj97fi,0,,,1,"So milk prices (in the US) at some point have risen from the beginning of COVID by ~32% (it's currently about 28%). I have two problems with that:


1. The price several years earlier is actually recorded as being almost as high.


2. The milk price since 2022 has actually dropped.


3. The supplement prices went up significantly more than 32%. As I said, double is a safe estimate.


4. Even if they would've only gone up by 32%, in reality there is probably still *more* profit to them in that (when we consider the 5-year inflation hasn't actually been 32% but 23% according to data) because A. that retains the profit margin against a higher base price and B. there are other expenses in the production and marketing chain.

comment,mrot2hz,1kj97fi,1,,,3,"That is still much higher than the relative rise in milk price, and as I said depending on the product and the platform where it's marketed the hike is even worse.

Now, I reiterate, the price of milk years pior to COVID (not only during 2008 but also around 2011 to 2014, and actually even 2004) has spiked to almost the level it's at now, but the prices weren't anywhere close to what they're nowadays.

So that tells me that either their major production costs (manufacturing and marketing combined) are not actually the product itself or the ingredients it's made of, or otherwise that the changing price tag is only loosely related to the dynamics of their production costs. Up means more expensive, and by a lot, while down means retaining existing price tag. Take a look how from the beginning of 2015 there's been a very steep decrease in milk prices which sustained itself until the beginning of 2019, yet during that entire period the Optimum Nutrition price tag, with the occasional noise of momentary dips, kept testing its $60 high threshold. It then smashed that threshold after the start of COVID and kept at it since.

As with practically all industries, there's this constant yearning to create a new ""acceptable"" price point (meaning the public has become used to its existence) which is higher than any previous ones, and an acceptable price point resists lowering very strongly, regardless of any possible increasingly favorable conditions the industry may experience at a later point.",WhatsUpLabradog,1746931095.0,,,,

I am curious if anyone is able to provide any lab documentation notes based on their theories of the quality going down.

As for myself, I have had great improvements in health from a handful of their products. I'm aware of many supplements being marketing gimmicks, but I also believe, based on my studies, reading lab documents on hundreds of different supplements, and feedback from my clients, that some of Thorne‚Äôs supplements are better quality than a lot of the basics we get at local stores like Fred Meyer, Walgreens, Costco, Safeway, etc.

From what I am able to find, the products Thorne has NSF Certification which include comprehensive third party testing and provide lab documentation on request are:

Super EPA, RecoveryPro, Whey Protein Isolate, Beta Alanine SR, Pre-Workout Elite, Magnesium Bisglycinate, Creatine, FloraSport 20B, Amino Complex, Melaton-3, and SynaQuell+.

The third party tested ones that also provide lab documentation upon request, but do not carry NSF certification, include the following: 

Berberine 500, ResveraCel, Vitamin D/K2 drops and softgels, Adrenal Cortex, Zinc Picolinate, Methyl-Guard, Basic Nutrients (2/Day, 5/Day), Omega-3 with CoQ10, B-Complex formulas, and Glutamine Powder.

Lastly, there are a few of Thorne‚Äôs products which do not provide full transparency on third party testing or lab documentation. Those included are:

Look for - 
Standards
Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP): GMP is a set of regulations and standards established by regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceuticals, food, and dietary supplements. Look for products that are manufactured in facilities adhering to GMP standards.

Third-Party Testing: Independent third-party testing involves having a separate organization verify the quality and content of a supplement. Look for brands that undergo third-party testing by organizations like NSF International, Informed-Choice, or USP (United States Pharmacopeia). These organizations test products for purity, potency, and absence of contaminants.

USP Verified Mark: The USP Verified Mark indicates that a supplement has been tested and verified by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) for identity, potency, purity, and quality. This is a well-recognized mark in the supplement industry.
NSF Certified for Sport: If you're an athlete or concerned about banned substances, look for supplements with the NSF Certified for Sport mark. This certification ensures that the product has been tested for substances prohibited by major athletic organizations.

Informed-Choice Certified: Similar to NSF Certified for Sport, the Informed-Choice certification is designed to ensure that a supplement is free of banned substances. This certification is particularly important for athletes and individuals subject to anti-doping regulations.

Non-GMO Project Verified: If you're looking for non-genetically modified (GMO) supplements, the Non-GMO Project Verified seal can help you identify products that meet rigorous GMO avoidance standards.

Certified Organic: If organic sourcing is important to you, look for supplements that have been certified organic by reputable organizations such as the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) or other regional certifying bodies.

EU GMP Certification:

ISO 22000 or FSSC 22000: These food safety management system certifications apply to the entire supply chain. ISO 22000 lays out the framework for managing food safety hazards, while FSSC 22000 is a more rigorous certification scheme recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). Both are excellent markers for ensuring that your supplement is produced in a thoroughly controlled environment.

HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points): Although more of a systematic preventive approach than a certification mark, a validated HACCP plan shows that the manufacturer actively identifies and controls potential hazards at critical points in the production process, which enhances overall safety and product purity.

EU Organic Certification: For products bought on organic claims, the EU Organic logo certifies that the ingredients have been produced and processed according to strict organic standards, reducing the likelihood of synthetic chemicals or contaminants.

BRC (British Retail Consortium) or IFS (International Food Standard): While more commonly seen on larger food production operations, these certifications can also be applied to supplement manufacturers. They indicate adherence to internationally recognized food safety standards across the production process.


ISURA is a Canadian-based, independent, not-for-profit organization that verifies and certifies natural health supplements and food products through rigorous laboratory testing. When you see a product marked as ""ISURA lab tested,"" it means the product has undergone comprehensive analysis by ISURA‚Äôs accredited laboratories, which adhere to strict quality and safety standards (they‚Äôre ISO 17025 accredited for specific lab methods and operate under an ISO 9001 certified quality management system",FormalIllustrator5,1746991730.0,,,,

comment,mrnhg44,1kj92dd,2,,,0,"Take the following with a grain of salt.

According to ChatGPT:

 ‚ÄúThorne HealthTech was acquired by L Catterton, a global consumer-focused investment firm, in a deal valued at approximately $680 million. The acquisition was announced in August 2023 and completed in the fourth quarter of that year, resulting in Thorne becoming a privately held company.  Ôøº


Following the acquisition, Colin Watts, a seasoned executive with experience at The Vitamin Shoppe, Walgreens, and WeightWatchers Health Solutions, was appointed as CEO. Under his leadership, Thorne has emphasized expanding its direct-to-consumer offerings, including personalized health solutions and at-home diagnostic tests, while maintaining its commitment to high-quality, science-backed supplements.  Ôøº


Regarding concerns about product quality post-acquisition, there is no concrete evidence indicating a decline. Thorne continues to operate its vertically integrated manufacturing facility in South Carolina, which supports stringent quality control measures.  However, some online discussions have surfaced where individuals express dissatisfaction, citing issues like perceived ineffectiveness or lack of transparency in providing Certificates of Analysis (COAs). These accounts are anecdotal and do not necessarily reflect systemic problems.

In summary, while Thorne has undergone significant corporate changes, there is no substantiated evidence to suggest a decline in product quality. The company appears to be focusing on innovation and expanding its reach while upholding its established quality standards. As with any supplement brand, individual experiences may vary, and it‚Äôs advisable to consult healthcare professionals when considering new products.‚Äù",JaciOrca,1746912723.0,,,,

It is also the least expensive brand out there if you buy the 2.2 pound bag.  Their beta alanine works like beta alanine because it definitely gives me the flush. It uses the same pathway as niacin, and that stuff really makes me flush!! 

Dr. Rhonda Patrick just did a Q&A, and discussed beta alanine.  It can deplete Taurine so I take it every day. Studies show that 4-6 grams of beta alanine per day increases carnosine levels. Carnosine buffers acidity, and delays muscle fatigue allowing for better workouts & muscle hypertrophy. If we take 4-6 grams a day in 4-weeks carnosine levels can increase by 64% and by 10-weeks it can be up to 80%.  There are high responders & low responders, but the sweet spot is 5.6-6.4 grams a day for people doing maximum high intensity exercises like weight lifting, etc.",phoenixgirlie29,1746932404.0,,,,

comment,mrmh10z,1kj8nh5,1,,,0,">daily to help with **restless leg** like symptoms

Try magnesiumbiglycinate as this form is bio-absorbable and used for muscle related things. Also, the added glycine will relax your nerves/cns. Be aware that magnesium needs to be balanced with calcium and with the long half life and satiety in the body of mg, so you don't need to take it every day. Balance it out, for example every 48H.

It's also possible that you got a cheap form of magnesium (oxide), with low bio-availability and the rest filled with fillers (stearate etc). If you are able, buy the 100% powder form and dose it yourself.

>and a multi vitamin¬†

Read the label and check if it has vitamin B6 (in pyroxide form), as this form of vitamine B6 is neurotoxic. Of course, you're not taking megadoses, but still, it's a fat solulable vitamin and those kind of vitamins accumulate in the fatty tissue. Use the methylated form of vitamine B6, this is a non-neurotoxic version and bioavailable.

submission,1kj853v,,0,Best supplement after SSRI injury? Excuse my typos as I have aphasia(trouble focusing on words),0.14,,"Hello everyone,  
So I'm a girl and fast tapering off SSRI caused TBI Chemical brain injury of sorts and I'm looking for supplements that will help with my cripling aphasia. I can't focus on any cognitive task and anythingI do now is out of my muscles memory. It almost feel like I can't use my brain anymore. I make so many grammetical mistakes, while speaking I struggle making coherent sentences. Its very embarrassing.   
  
 So it started 8months ago when I injured myself with doing yoga and injured my left lower back, with some or SI injury.  
  
I visited chiropractors, PT, physio doctors, nothing helped so I had to visit neurosurgeon in the end,  
  
This doctor prescribed me P\*aroxetine without my acknowledgment with my meds and fucked me up so bad.  
  
I had no clue what I was eating untill the 2nd day. My mom hid those medicines from me bc she knows i'm very critical about NSAIDs,SSRI, SNRI painkillers and any kind of medicines. And she just wanted to see me healed so she deliberately fed those medicines. On the second day I was experiencing extreme extreme anxiety, heart palpitation, fast heart beat, brain fog, double vision so I pleaded my mom to show those meds to me. Once I found out that the doctor prescribed me an SSRI without my acknowledge. I was so upset and angry that day that I took natural laxative to get rid of any traces of SSRI in my body or brain. I didn't know SSRI's are meant to be tapered slowly with lower dose for several days and then completely get rid of it, the fast tapering off SSRI immediately caused TBI Chemical brain injury of sorts. I experienced the worst withdrawals, include again extreme anxiety, heart palpitation, seeing white and orange orbs. for several days, extreme migraines and headaches for several weeks and then months. Its been 8months since that experience.  Now the anxiety have subsided after following up with diet and supplements and other nootropics. But none of the nootropics are bale to fix my severe aphasia, where I make several grammer spelling mstakes while speaking or typing. I can't focus on what I'm writing either and most of my wiritng comes out of muscle memory. I have frontal lobe heaviness aswell, Can't focus on cognitive based task. Have hard time making decisions as I can't trust myself or my body anymore. Is there a supplement I could try taking for severe aphasia/ dyslexia It's very embarrassing I feel completely disabled, mentally as well physically because of the back injury. i wouldn't want to visit another neurosurgeon or doctor. I hate doctors now.

Supplements that I supplement myself in the beginning 8months ago before the injury was- bacopa (brahmi), B complex, copious amount of methylated mecobalamin B12, magnesium glycinate, L-theanine, Q10, L-carnite, Lycopene, astaxanthin. (And I experimented with homeopathic medicine like Selenium drops and Tarantula 100CH (one drop for my ADHD)  for a week and then left it all long before the injury or meds)

Supplement that I supplement myself with myself is Magnesium glycinate, Q10, L-carnite, zinc, B complex, black seed oil, L-5 MTFR methylated folic acid (in hope that will cure my memory and severe aphasia)

If you‚Äôve only been on it two days you don‚Äôt need to taper off because ssris don‚Äôt start working that quickly. They take weeks to start having any real effect.

You don‚Äôt need to taper off an SSRI after 2 doses. Heck, even after 2 weeks.. any discomfort would be very mild if there at all.",slipperyinit,1746881337.0,,,,
comment,mrlr5pv,1kj853v,3,,,0,"Sorry you're going through this üíö it sounds awful. 

It's not possible to experience withdrawal after only 2 days of an SSRI. However it sounds like you had some side effects from the SSRIs whilst you were on them, and the also experienced panic attacks and migraines when you realised you'd consumed them. That's not to say your symptoms weren't real, because they were, but withdrawal was probably not the mechanism. Anxiety is a very powerful thing on the body and that coupled with the side effects you were already experiencing, plus you mentioned having anxiety and ADHD before you went on the meds too, it could all just be a lot for you nervous system to handle. 

The fast heart rate, palpitations and anxiety are explained by panic attacks and the orbs of light can be explained by migraines. 

As for the long lasting aphasia... I have seen reports of people experiencing long term damage from single doses of SSRIs. One example I saw recently was someone on some other Reddit post who took an SSRI on an empty stomach, immediately began belching excessively and from there developed permanent functional dyspepsia. 

There's also many reports of permanent sexual dysfunction following SSRI use but that's more following long term use. 

Regardless, I think not enough is known about the risks of srris and the sometimes permanent consequences that even single use can have. 

That doesn't mean your aphasia will be permanent. I do believe it could be tied to your ADHD, as trouble with focusing and dopamine are likely related to aphasia. Are you taking any ADHD meds that could help with this?

I'd also focus on supplements and foods that support brain health, and foods/activities that support dopamine and serotonin. And getting back onto some ADHD meds if you're not already on them. 

Wean off most of the supplements you're on currently (don't quit all cold turkey as that might make you feel like shit). 

Then focus on high strength fish oil, linseed oil, flax seeds, avocado, walnuts, blueberries. For brain health. Also exercise, sunlight, socialising and puzzles like sudoku, word games, are all good for brain health. 

Then look up foods and activities for supporting dopamine and serotonin production too. Salmon, green beans, sunlight, exercise. 

Lastly I'd suggest seeing a psychiatrist for the aphasia and trouble focusing. You may just need different meds. 

And a clinical psychologist to see if that route could help in some way. It's possible that nervous system work could resolve these last remaining symptoms for you.",Anjunabeats1,1746891774.0,,,,
comment,mrl9et8,1kj853v,2,,,0,"Wow. You don‚Äôt have a TBI injury caused by an SSRI. I‚Äôve literally never seen the phrase ‚ÄúSSRI injury‚Äù before. But you are so panicked and neurotic and possibly delusional that you‚Äôve built up this entire narrative to explain an injury you are sure you have even though you have no real differential diagnosis and the symptoms are so general and non specific they could indicate a hundred things or nothing at all. You seem incredibly paranoid‚Äîand look, I‚Äôm no fan of the medical system or psychiatrists in general, but sometimes it‚Äôs best for the layman to acknowledge that she‚Äôs out of her depth. I can tell you‚Äôre out of your depth because nothing in your post makes sense with how these drugs work or how TBI works. Your post does show symptoms of severe paranoia, extreme anxiety, obsessive compulsive rumination, and displays a vastly overinflated and unwarranted sense of confidence and certainty that verges on mania. 


You need to go to a doctor. Someone you can talk openly with and establish rapport. Same goes for finding a counselor. I‚Äôm not trying to be mean with this comment, but the tone and content of your post speaks of someone having a mental health crisis, not a physiological or neurological or ‚ÄúSSRI‚Äù injury. 


You do not get SSRI withdrawal symptoms after three days. You taper down after you‚Äôve been taking the medication for months or even years. Moreover most times I‚Äôve had to abruptly stop taking an SSRI I‚Äôve felt absolutely nothing except eventually a rise in anxiety. Some people feel weird zaps. Nobody. Not a single person. Has suffered a traumatic brain injury from taking three days worth of an SSRI followed by a laxative. That‚Äôs cartoonishly naive and shows that you don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre talking about. 


Take a deep breath. Leave your phone behind and go for a walk. Calm down. Then try to rationally and simply help yourself by letting others help you. Popping random supplements to fix an imagined injury is not going to make you feel less anxious or worried or feel like something isn‚Äôt wrong anymore. Just breathe and do the next right thing.",drunkthrowwaay,1746885849.0,,,,

How grateful I am to you for considering all my symptoms and not gaslighting into believing I was exaggerating them o wasn't experiencing them at all. I did have ADHD all before this. I think the anxiety came after my back injury and how I was house bounded for days and wasn't able to do anything except lay on my bed hoping every day that my back will recover by itself. I also became depressed bc of this. But you're very much right, maybe that anxiety might have exacerbated the symptoms even more and what I was going through the SSRI. Probably so.  
I think I struggled with the extreme symptoms first week, then I withdrawls, then it got better on the 4-5th month.

Now I don't experience ADHD, anxiety, depression or any other with drawl symptoms anymore. I just struggle with really bad aphasia and And nope I haven't taken any ADHD medication ever except for praxil/ssri and before that I was also given aripiprazole that did nothing to me except that it gave me even more anxiety for few days but tapering off of that way easy and again it did nothing harmful to me.

You're right :') I need to wean off on so many supplements and trying to incorporate the food that you have mentioned below. Also probably get an MRI or visit psychiatrist for my aphasia.

P.S.: I don‚Äôt want to consider medication because of their side effects. 
Thanks 
 
I want to add this: 

Thank you all for the answers: to reply at some of the questions: I take magnesium, vitamin D, ltheanine, inositol, vitamin B 12, omega 3, calcium. I do some somatic exercises , stretching and yoga, I‚Äôm in therapy for more than 5 years, I do some nervous system regulation like breathwork and sometimes cold showers. 
I‚Äôm attentive with alimentation lately, not much sugar, now I‚Äôve decided to eliminate lactose and gluten as well and focus more on protein , fruits vegetables and healthy fats. 
I have a bed routine, more or less waking up at same hour, what I need to do more is expose myself to light in the early morning and decrease exposure to blue light 1 h before bed. 
More or less I know that I need to adjust some stressful contexts of my life especially with work and family but there is no solution only in a few months so I needed some help until then.  
Still exhausted so I needed something for make me go through the day.
Thank you üôè all for implication and great advice.  I will try 5-htp and saffron cause I‚Äôve never took them, to see if there is working for me.",ShivaInSilence,1746855765.0,120,Recommendations ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kj32yj/depression_and_burnout/

comment,mrjra1m,1kj32yj,16,,,0,"I would get your vitamin D level checked. Having vitamin D injections to bring my levels up has improved my energy and mood, along with magnesium, b vitamins, zinc and iron. Someone else mentioned gut issues, do you have anything that might contribute to vitamin deficiency for example coeliac disease?

You can try things like SJW- it did work for my mood very well but to be honest I got sexual side effects from SJW which I didn‚Äôt like. 5htp made me sleepy. I‚Äôm still considering an antidepressant tho if things don‚Äôt improve 
 more over the next weeks to bridge the gap while my vitamin D levels are still coming up more as it‚Äôs a long journey. There are different options so you could explore if things get bad.

Otherwise, for depression optimised saffron is also good. For the burnout or if you are prone to anxiety, I‚Äôve found L-theannine to be amazing for that. 

I would say exercise, getting outside, early morning and evening sunlight, eating and sleeping well, socialising, and having something to look forward to are very important for tackling depression.",Capital_Self1758,1746857971.0,,,,

The side effects are negligible compared to the positive change in mental state.

comment,mrokt3q,1kj32yj,2,,,0,"Focus on food first & supplements as a bonus! Complex carbs, high protein, healthy unsaturated fats, fiber and phytonutrients like antioxidants.

Another thing to consider is your gut-brain axis. Neurotransmitter function is directly dependent on the state of your intestinal health. Opt for prebiotic and probiotic-rich foods, like sauerkraut, kimchi or yogurt.

For supplements, B vitamins are co-dependant on 1 another so I recommend a B complex for adrenal function (stress hormone regulation). Vitamin D and NAC are also beneficial, along with magnesium glycinate (highly absorbable and easy on digestion).

Before bed, take some calming herbs like chamomile or passionflower. 

Also, remember that exercise and stress management is critical for mood support. If you're into energy healing at all, consider acupuncture or yoga to help restore the flow of stuck emotions.

I've personally had a lot of success with all of these changes & wish you the best of luck ‚ú®Ô∏è remember, holistic health is highly unique to every individual and will often require a lot of experimentation. But in my opinion, it's always worth it.",justbeingania,1746927794.0,,,,

Two that stand out scientifically:

* **Malkangni (Celastrus paniculatus)** ‚Äî In Ayurveda its extensively used for cognitive fatigue and burnout. Modern research notes its neuropsychopharmacological effects, especially in modulating neurotransmitters linked to mood regulation and reducing mental exhaustion. A couple of animal model studies even suggest it boosts cognitive flexibility under stress without the crash some adaptogens can bring.
* **Brahmi (Bacopa monnieri)** ‚Äî known for its anti-anxiety, mood-stabilizing, and neuroprotective properties. Clinical trials have shown improved memory, reduced cortisol levels, and better emotional regulation in people facing chronic stress and fatigue.

If you‚Äôre the kind of person who likes to read the research before trying anything, these are well-documented.

comment,mrtjuns,1kj32yj,2,,,2,"We can take all the supplements in the world, but if we're not fulfilling our very basic human needs, we will feel out of place. :)

Sleeping properly, waking up early and getting sunlight exposure on our skin and in our eyes alone (never directly) can level us up with mood and fixes a bunch of hormonal things as well. Same with regular exercise, as simple as walking 30-45 minutes a day to start. There are scientists who make podcasts and books about this stuff, you can check out clips by people like Dr. Andrew Huberman, Dr. Rhonda Patrick, or Dr. Matthew Walker. But at the end of the day, I think we all know the basic ""right"" things we should be doing.

Healthy social support is usually the most difficult to obtain, but now more than ever we're connected via the Internet, so there are resources online as well as resources to find IRL meet ups.

Unless you're really in the pits, or have some extreme symptoms, I'd personally question whether or not you'd want to go the pharma meds route just yet. Try working towards these simple things first before deciding on those, is my humble opinion.

Whatever you're going through, it will pass, my friend. You will fight through it and come out stronger. I've been there, and go there often myself. But no one and no thing will really save us. We have to really ignite our own fire and keep it burning best we can. Check out some motivational speeches on YouTube - I like ""Motiversity"" and ""Absolute Motivation"". Just throw them on and listen, and feel fired up, and then maybe grab a pen and paper and write some commitments to yourself on what you will be doing going forward.

- I had really bad anxiety due to it, so I watched and listened to a lot of resources on anxiety and panic attacks, it all comes down to one thing: Stop ruminating! Being anxious about anxiety is what perpetuate it, learn to let the body go numb, anxious when it comes. Anxiety cannot kill you, you need to use your conscious mind to train the unconscious mind that body is safe.

submission,1kiy2sw,,0,Brain healing advice!,0.36,,"Hi Everyone! Here is my brother's story:

(TLDR)

I started eating more beef in 2020 and gained a six pack only eating meat, veggies, fruit, and ""healthy"" carbs (rice and beans).¬†

I lost all my gains after being trapped in a Utah psych ward evidently run by pedophiles in 2024.

I am currently trying to use the carnivore diet (with plenty of butter lattes) to reverse ""medication"" induced damage (hormonal issues and 25lbs of fat gain).

(the journey)

I was on a road trip to California in October of 2024. I hit a deer on the highway in Utah and asked the police for help (this was after driving non-stop without sleep for 25 hours). The police recommended going to the ER for drug testing and I went along (partly because I was sleep deprived). The ER said I was clear for drugs but refused to let me go and sent me to a psych ward instead.

At the psych ward I refused to take medication and so they forcefully injected me with drugs. I was released after a month of medication (haloperidol, zyprexa, invega sustenna). For the next few months I had awful side effects including jaw twisting, sedation, drooling, shaking, blurry vision, extreme constipation, etc. (the works).

I also gained 25lbs of fat the first back home month while still eating healthy. My hormone levels became messed up (testosterone, prolactin) and I am still cognitively slow from the medication (3 minor car accidents). Brain damage isn't possible, right?...

When I received my medical records I found that most of it was fabricated (seemingly just so doctors could bill my insurance). The doctors said I was hallucinating visually and auditorily and ""worried"" about hackers and the CIA / FBI but none of this ever happened.

Doing some research, Chat GPT found that the hospital changed their name in the past because hospital staff were caught sexually assaulting a 12-year old girl patient. (My ""treatment"" at the ""hospital"" started to make much more sense given their history). Randomly it also turns out that Paris Hilton was abused in a similar facility as a teenager in the exact same town.

[https://www.ksl.com/article/46714354/charges-staffer-at-utah-behavior-hospital-charged-with-sexually-abusing-girl](https://www.ksl.com/article/46714354/charges-staffer-at-utah-behavior-hospital-charged-with-sexually-abusing-girl)

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/06/26/paris-hilton-testimony-congress-childhood-abuse/74218707007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/06/26/paris-hilton-testimony-congress-childhood-abuse/74218707007/)

On a positive note, the carnivore diet seems to be the only thing that stops me from constantly gaining fat at this point.

(the carnivore diet)

The forced medication (""thought"" to mainly block dopamine) caused issues with my hormones (testosterone: 900 -> 400, prolactin: 5 -> 20, glucose: 80 -> 110) and led me to gain 25lbs of fat in a month (165lb -> 190lb) only eating meat, veggies, and fruit (with occasional rice and beans).

I also lost all cardiorespiratory fitness. I used to run easy half marathons but now cannot even run half a mile due to swelling throughout my body and face.¬†

After going full carnivore (no more veggies, fruits, or carbs) I stopped gaining fat (weight is stable at 190lbs). I am currently on month 4 of carnivore (and month 4 of being free from ""medication"") and my testosterone has increased (900 -> 400 -> 650) but so has my prolactin (5 -> 20 -> 28). I can also run a (1) mile again.

(to be continued‚Ä¶)

The drug should be fully out of my body in roughly 2 more months (although some people reported side effects for years‚Ä¶). Hopefully I can start losing weight and healing at this point.

It would be great to see if anyone has fully recovered from psychiatric medications and if there are any supplements or techniques (e.g., sauna) that helped you out.",unbutter-robot,1746838414.0,11,Recommendations ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kiy2sw/brain_healing_advice/

comment,mrikx95,1kiwp5r,3,,,0,"Where are you from? Supplement brands are very different in North America and Europe.

Check it's krill oil from free krill and not from factories, which probably comes from a single supplier worldwide that harvests it in the Antarctic and processes it in Norway. The reason for this is fish factories give really shitty food to the fish there, so free fish have so much better nutrition and health.

Astaxanthin is probably in the range of 12 micrograms (¬µg) per pill, rather than 12 miligrams (mg), because 12 mg of astaxanthin is a lot.

For your reference, this is the krill oil info per pill (1 a day) I've taken for years:

*Phospholipids: 200 mg*

*Total Omega 3: 110 mg*

*EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid): 60 mg*

*DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid): 28 mg*

*Total Omega 6: 10 mg*

*Choline: 25 mg*

*Astaxanthin: 50 ¬µg*

comment,mriq0im,1kiwp5r,2,,,0,"Krill oil does not have high concentrations of omega 3's. If you got one gram pills of krill oil and took four, then you'd end up taking ~~1-1.5 g~~ 800-1000mg of EPA+DHA.

Astaxanthin is also not highly concentrated in krill oil. Read the label for details, but usually, it's a few hundred micrograms at best. Personally, I take 12 milligrams a day in one pill from Sports Research. I find their product to be a good balance of value and quality. A popular option is BioAstin. You might start with just 4-6 mg.

Krill oil has the advantage of providing phospholipids, which can increase the absorption of omega 3's, as well as some other nutrients. Budget wise, it's probably better to take a couple grams of omega 3 from good fish oil.

Using cholecalciferol together with magnesium glycinate can lead to elevated magnesium blood levels, particularly in individuals with reduced kidney function. Symptoms of high magnesium levels may include nausea, vomiting, flushing, drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, muscle weakness, reduced reflexes, low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and impaired breathing.

*Vit D & Mylanta ; I also sometimes use mylanta and read this also! 

Chronic use of aluminum hydroxide or other medications that contain aluminum may cause toxicity in patients with advanced kidney disease due to impaired ability to clear aluminum from the body. Aluminum can accumulate and deposit in various tissues over time, causing toxicities such as weak bones, fractures, bone pain, muscle weakness, anemia, mental changes, seizures, dementia, and coma. The risk of aluminum toxicity may be further increased during treatment with vitamin D or vitamin D analogs like cholecalciferol, which increase the absorption of aluminum from the intestine. You should avoid taking medications that contain aluminum unless otherwise directed by your doctor

The only source I found was that once upon a time, somewhere in the world there was an unnamed Naturopath who had a client who took \~10,000IU vit D daily for a year and was later found to have elevated creatine levels which indicated kidney damage.

We're missing quite a lot of context there. Magnesium clears the body quickly, like up to 70% gone in under 24 hrs. It would be difficult to get an ultra-high level unless you have a pre-existing condition like, oh, say, kidney disease, which is known to cause elevated levels of magnesium.

Same goes for anyone with the MTHFR gene.,melon1924,1746867635.0,,,,
comment,mrk8wee,1kitso3,1,,,0,"Thid is what chatgpt says:
It‚Äôs understandable to be worried when you see an abnormal lab result, especially with something like vitamin B12 that‚Äôs occasionally linked to serious conditions. Let‚Äôs break this down calmly and clearly.

1. Could your supplements be causing elevated B12?

Yes, absolutely.
The Thorne Basic Nutrients 2/Day contains 600 mcg of methylcobalamin (B12) per serving ‚Äî 25,000% of the recommended daily intake. That alone can elevate your blood B12 levels well above the normal range, especially if taken consistently.

Also, whey protein can naturally contain small amounts of B12, and Factor meals may be fortified with B12 as well, adding to your total intake.

So your elevated B12 is very likely due to supplementation, not a sign of disease.


---

2. What‚Äôs the concern with elevated B12 and cancer?

It‚Äôs true that very high B12 levels in people not taking supplements can sometimes be a marker of underlying conditions like liver disease, kidney issues, or some cancers (e.g. blood-related cancers). But this doesn‚Äôt apply if you're supplementing, as the elevated level is artificially created by intake ‚Äî not by your body producing or accumulating B12 due to disease.

If your doctor knows you‚Äôre supplementing and still had concerns, they would likely order additional tests based on other symptoms or lab abnormalities. If B12 is the only concerning value and you‚Äôre feeling generally well, it‚Äôs probably not a red flag.


---

3. What should you do now?

Stop or pause your Thorne multivitamin for now.

Recheck B12 levels in a few weeks (6‚Äì8 weeks after stopping is ideal).

Track symptoms, if any (fatigue, neurological signs, etc.).

Talk to your doctor if other values were abnormal, or if they recommended more tests.",Change1964,1746868651.0,,,,
comment,mrmztw9,1kitso3,1,,,0,"How high was your result?

The thorne multi has tonnes of B12 in it. You have to stop all supplements a minimum of 2 days before any blood tests, if you didn't do this then the test is invalid and needs to be repeated.

Slightly elevated B12 is fine if you are supplementing, my B12 is always about 1100 even 2 days after stopping (NHS ref range is something like 350-950). It's not an issue",evilkitty69,1746906631.0,,,,
comment,mroio96,1kitso3,1,,,0,"Iirc, taking B12 supplements within up to a week of lab tests can skew results.

You can lower your dose or skip taking any B12 for a month or so to bring levels down if it's a major concern. Iirc, Thorne Basic has pretty high B12 so you might want to look for a multivitamin with lower B12.

Seeking Health Multivitamin One has 26 mcg B12 (as methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin in regular; hydroxo and adenosyl in methyl-free). Still a lot higher than RDA but significantly lower than Thorne. If you decide to skip the multi and supplement selectively, they also have a B-complex without B9 and B12 at all (B Minus).",rui-no-onna,1746926961.0,,,,

comment,mrhpp7o,1kitso3,1,,,0,"Hey man I have some friendly advice here, If you're trying to avoid excessive B12 since that's what your doctor is saying.. while still covering your daily nutrient needs, it‚Äôs completely doable by choosing a few carefully selected supplements instead of a typical multivitamin.

Start with a reliable magnesium glycinate supplement. Best to take this in the evening to help ease tension, support muscles, and encourage deeper sleep. Add in a clean omega 3 source like a high quality algae oil or a tested fish oil such as Bare Biology / Nordic Naturals. Taking it with a high fat meal (eggs, avacado) helps your body absorb the fats and helps with inflammation. 

You're already set with your d3 and k2 which do a great job of supporting immunity and bone strength. For minerals like zinc, selenium, and copper, you can keep it natural by eating a mix of nuts and seeds, one Brazil nut, a tablespoon of raw pumkin seeds, a tablespoon of sunflower seeds, 2 tablespoons of cashews for a great whole food sourced snack that supports your thyroid. Since it seems ideal to take a few day break avoiding B12, you can take a methyl free B complex like the B Minus from Seeking Health, can help give your body the rest of the B vitamins without the risk of your levels climbing too high. To tie everything together, a multivitamin without B12 like the one from Vital Nutrients helps fill in any other gaps without overdoing it.

This setup allows your body to stay consistent and well supported without pushing your B12 levels up further.",iKoshibo,1746827628.0,,,,

oh and it acts a stimulant for me! i get insomina. although unlike stimulants it doesnt make my skin bad.

***so how do i keep the good skin effect while reducing the migraine side effect. what can i take that will cut this effect while keeping the good stuff. i'm already microdosing 1/2 or 1/3 of a 1000mg glycine pill. i want to keep taking glycine while toning down the migraine and depression effect.*** 

i try to take the glycine with butchers broom and calcium d-glucarate as they help skin and veins (i have pots, pcos, rosacea, and acne). on their own i've noticed a milder effect with the two.

I have vitamin b12 deficiency and My testosterone levels are 4.01 ng/ml which is around 400. I feel it‚Äôs low for my age. Am I right? The range is b/w 3 and 10 so I‚Äôm on the lower end of it.

Start lifting heavy.

Do challenging compound exercises like deadlifts, squats, chin ups, dips, presses, rows, push ups, pistols, etc ..it can be calisthenics, with barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, bands,etc 

I personally prefer a combination of barbells and calisthenics with some other weights added in for variety like bands, dumbells, etc. 

Aim to hit 5 reps with good form on your heaviest sets. Every few months test your maxes with good form. 

Do you have a lot of stress in your life? If so, work to reduce it via lifestyle changes and or supplements.

I‚Äôd work lifestyle first and foremost. Lift heavy weights for less reps, focusing on compound movements for the legs like squats and deadlifts. Incorporate sprinting intervals for cardio. Get more vitamin D (you may not be deficient but vitamin D deficiency levels only account for rickets, not testosterone.) You can go outside for this but a supplement is more efficient. Try eating 50g of dietary fats for optimal hormone synthesis. Take 5g of creatine for the lifting as well. If you want to get more out there you can also take tongkat ali, but depending on the root cause of your low T it may or may not help.



The above is essentially baseline for raising your testosterone. Any decent urologist would recommend that before you go a TRT route. If all of the above doesn‚Äôt get your levels to a more appreciable state and you don‚Äôt feel better, you may have something going on and you‚Äôre then way over the pay grade of anyone in this subreddit.",[deleted],1746824015.0,,,,

- Working out, lifting heavy weights with proper form and sprinting.

- Drinking coffee, I am a regular coffee consumer and it's proven scientifically that coffee increases testosterone.

- Cold showers from time to time.

- Taking multivitamins and omega-3.

- Sleep, my sleep schedule is kinda messed up but nonetheless sleep is crucial for testosterone.

comment,mrjrfys,1kirzzg,2,,,0,"Salmon has a fair amount of vitamin d around 600IU/100g so it's one of the food sources that can actually keep your levels somewhat within sufficient ranges if you eat enough. 

Glass might not completely block vitamin D production depending on the type, many modern types of glass have filters to avoid large buildings overheating, same for cars but many older types of glass actually allow enough of the UVB spectrum through so that you might have 10-15% of the vitamin D generation you would without the glass. UVA can create small amounts of vitamin D as well.

Mushrooms can be a very significant source depending on how they are manufactured, sliced button mushrooms exposed to sunlight (UVB) can contain up to 100.000 IU/100g so they have the potential to be a very significant source, if your vitamin D test showed high D2 and you don't take supplements it's almost certainly from mushrooms.",Throwaway_6515798,1746858064.0,,,,

I am 25 year old and started working in an office about half a year ago, so I figured I needed Vitamin D since I don't get to see the sun much. I am also Asian with darker skin so according to the internet, I need more exposure to get the right levels.

I started taking 5000 IUs everyday, but now am suffering from Insomnia, so I wonder if they relate to each other. I am also taking Magnesium Glycinate.

Any thought is appreciated. Thank you so much!",AbroadAmbitious9372,1746815444.0,52,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kipp7v/is_vitamin_d_causing_my_insomnia/

2) It's possible to have that reaction to vitamin d. An adverse reaction to magnesium glycinate is however more likely.

It wasnt until i introduced potassium/zinc that i started feeling an even amount of energy through the day and i can fall asleep in less than 20 minutes now. Whereas before id roll in bed for 2-4 hrs without any feeling of sleepiness but i would be exhausted. try some coconut water before bed and see if potassium does the trick.  If that works try adding Bananas, sweet potatoes into your diet or just get potassium supplements.

So I had blood work done about a year ago that showed my vitamin D completely out of range and my ferritin beginning to tank as well, likely from the lack of vit D. My doc told me to start taking a daily multi and the also add in supplemental D and iron. I didn't do it for a long time... depression, life adjustments, and the iron I was trying wrecked my gut. Thankfully, I found a new one and I've been keeping consistent with the regimen for about a month now. Better late than never.

Doc also is pretty convinced my hair loss is directly tied to these two things (plus stress). I feel like it's getting worse, not better, and I thought maybe I'd at least TRY Nutrafol. Some people swear by it, some say it's snake oil... I say I'm desperate, and what can it hurt.

The thing is... Nutrafol has vitamin D (plus A and another letter... E, maybe). It is obviously not a multivitamin, and doesn't contain iron. But I'm wondering if I start it should I let it take the place of my supplemental D so I'm not way overdoing it. My levels are very low (out of range), so on the one hand it might help at first. But I obviously don't want to create a new problem if my levels start to recover, and I'm not going to be able to do a blood work check again until later this year most likely.

Advice? Thanks",CutestCatfish,1746801453.0,7,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kik2lt/how_should_i_adjust_my_regimen/

My question is this, I need advice on how to replenish my vitamin d AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, BUT safely


For now the supplement I have has

Vitamin K2 as (menaquinone) 200 ¬µg 

Vitamin D3 as (colecalciferol) 50 ¬µg 


I want to take at least 16000ui of vitamin d a day (7 of the capsules I got)
But I'm afraid that might be too much vit k2? 


My doc seems a bit dull and possibly uninformed about the importance of vitamin d, he prescribed me 25000 UI PER WEEK! which if would do anything would also take months to have any effects, months that I can't afford as I need be strong and as energetic as possible in order to be able to help my father (also it's not like I love having wrist pain and panic attacks lol)


I know VIT D is non toxic but I have no idea about the impact of such an high amount of K2 that I would be assuming if I took 7 capsules as I intend

comment,mrdos5r,1ki9htf,44,,,0,"Alrighttt, friend. After writing for an extended time.. I have a comprehensive list to meet your criteria.

A great starting point is lion‚Äôs mane mushroom. It‚Äôs been researched for its ability to support brain cell regeneration and help with focus over time. Brands like Real Mushrooms and Host Defense are solid choices, they are very clean. Take it on an empty stomach in the morning to get the most from it. If your thoughts tend to race like myn or you are feeling overstimulated. You could pair it with L-theanine, it can totally help smooth things out. It works especially well if you drink coffee, calming the nervous energy while keeping you alert. I'd go with thorne on this one. Super clean and tested!

Also, when libido or energy levels start to feel off, tongkat ali is a herb worth considering. It‚Äôs been shown to naturally support testosterone production and physical vitality. Lost Empire Herbs makes a very high integrity version. It‚Äôs best taken earlier in the day with a rotation schedule. Like five days on, two off, can really help keeping it effective over time. Zinc is another vital piece of the puzzle. It plays a direct role in hormone balance and immune defense. Thorne is also my go 2 for this! Evening is a good time to take it, ideally with food, but steer clear of pairing it with dairy or calcium heavy meals, since they compete with each other for absorption. But, truthfully.. I don't supplement zinc, copper, or selenium as you can get recommend daily amount of these important thyroid healthy nuts from 1 tbsp raw pumpkin seeds, 1 tbsp sunflower seeds, 2 tbsp of cashews and 1 brazil nut.

If you‚Äôre trying to feel more emotionally steady or manage stress better, ashwagandha has potential to help. (Though,  keep in mind, its ideal to rotate 6 weeks on, 2-3 weeks off) Especially in concentrated forms like KSM-66. It‚Äôs known to promote a sense of calm and improve how your body deals with stress over time. Gaia Herbs and Organic India are two companies that keep their formulas clean and transparent from what Ive been able to find. Evening dose with food can prep your body. Magnesium glycinate is another strong ally here, it supports your nervous system and can make it easier to unwind and fall asleep. You‚Äôll get the most benefit taking it about an hour before bed, away from a big meal. Id go for thorne or Seeking Health for the magnesium. Pure encapsulations makes super pure magnesium but they are owned by nestle and i don't support child labor. Haha

For better sleep overall, glycine is a simple amino acid that can make a real difference. Around 3 grams before bed can help your body cool down and enter deeper sleep without that foggy, sedated feeling the next morning. Thorne offers a very clean version of this. Can safely be taken alongside magnesium making for a calming, restorative nighttime routine to heal that body. ‚ù§Ô∏è

When it comes theart, brain,  eye, and joint health is where omega 3s shine. High quality fish oil from Nordic Naturels, especially in the more absorbable triglyceride forrm can 100% lower inflammation and keep your system running smoothly. Take it with a meal that includes healthy fat, (eggs, avacado) preferably breakfast or lunch. Vitamin D3 +K2 is another core nutrient that supports immune balance, hormones, and bone strength. K2 also helps spread calcium to your bones more evenly. Thorne is my go 2 on this. Early morning with breakfast is ideal as it can interfere with sleep.

To stay strong and support muscle recovery, creatine monohydrate is the most well resewrched and useful additions you can make. It helps with physical energy and brain function. Always look for the Creapure label from brands like Thorne. A daily 3‚Äì5 gram dose, taken after workouts or with a meal that is high in carbs, is usually ideal. If your diet occasionally falls short on protein, using a clean powder from Garden of Life can help fill in the gaps and keep your muscles fueled and recovering well.

Digestive health often gets overlooked, but it‚Äôs foundational.  Can help your gut stay balanced and support everything from mood to immune defense. Taking a probiotic 30mins to 1hr before breakfast or right before bed. I love the organically certified ancient nutrition probiotic.

comment,mrh16ge,1ki9htf,3,,,0,"As a guy in my 30s, I‚Äôve figured out a few key supplements that help keep me balanced, both physically and mentally:



1. Mental Health/Focus:

Ashwagandha (I‚Äôve used a few different brands, including Zandu‚Äôs and others with KSM-66) has been a lifesaver for managing stress and boosting energy without the crash.

Rhodiola is my go-to for mental clarity on those extra tiring days.

Bacopa has helped with memory, especially when brain fog kicks in.



2. Libido/Hormones:

Zinc has been solid for supporting testosterone levels.

Fenugreek has helped with maintaining a natural testosterone balance.

Vitamin D is essential for overall health, especially when I‚Äôm indoors a lot.



3. Mood:

Omega-3s (I like brands like Nordic Naturals) have been great for mood and brain health.

Magnesium keeps me feeling relaxed and balanced.

B-vitamins help with energy throughout the day, preventing any slumps.



4. Sleep:

L-Theanine helps me unwind before bed.

Ashwagandha (again, I‚Äôve had good results with Zandu‚Äôs and others with KSM-66) improves sleep quality and reduces anxiety.



5. Physical Health:

CoQ10 is my go-to for heart health and overall energy.

Turmeric (especially with added Piperine for better absorption) has been great for inflammation.

Probiotics (like those from Garden of Life) have done wonders for gut health.



6. Muscle/Fat:

Whey protein (I rotate between brands like ON and Vital Proteins) is essential for muscle maintenance.

Creatine has been great for strength and muscle retention.

CLA is a solid addition for fat loss without losing muscle.



I stick to brands that I trust, like Zandu for Ashwagandha and Turmeric, and Nordic Naturals for Omega-3s. For digestion and gut health, I swear by probiotics from trusted brands like Garden of Life.

comment,mrsdd2o,1ki9htf,2,,,0,"I'd start with fermented foods for the gut microbiome, home made yoghurts/kefir etc. This has a big effect on overall energy and mood, bigger than any one supplement 

Obviously make sure you're getting sunlight, get outside, bare feet on the ground, breathing properly etc

Supps I'm currently using with the same goals as you

Mag glycinate, vit d3, k2, taurine and ashwaghanda/theanine/tryptophan combo for sleep. The ash you may want to cycle as suggested. Sometimes it can make me a little apathetic but, it also helps me control emotions which helps with my work

Vit d is really foundational and most people are deficient.

Methylated b complex in the morning empty stomach. I added lions mane, bacopa monnieri, and shilajit/sea moss recently. Still evaluating the last few (lions mane onwards). Not totally sure I'm getting much from them but generally feel I have a bit more mental endurance. I half dose the methyl b. You may want to get a genetic test first before messing with this. I didn't and just assumed, but I get good effects for energy and even sleep. If I take a full dose, weirdly, it makes sleep worse. 

If I was to pick the top tier eating lots of fermented foods regularly, then it's vit d/k2 and B complex. Ashwaghanda/theanine/tryptophan is a close runner up as it helps me fall asleep quicker. Keep that gut healthy as it really has a big effect on overall energy and health.

Also you can't eat junk food and expect supplements to pick up the slack. It's like and extra 10% assuming you have good exercise and diet regimes in place. Spend the money here first.

Dopa Macuna is also highly effective but, I only buy this once or twice a year. It has quite a powerful mood and energy boosting ability. I think taking it habitually would have bad long term effects. It's the closest to a drug - like an antidepressant almost. I don't want to downregulate dopamine receptors so I keep it occasional. Winter usually when mood tends to dip. 

Stuff I didn't like:

Creatine for me is horrific. Wild insomnia. Had to throw it away
Tongkat ali. Maybe I got a bad brand but it gave me nausea. I may try it again from a different supplier. But I personally never noticed anything.

First start with a very basic stack : Creatine, D3+K2, Boron, Zinc+Copper, Calcium (if your intake from non-vegetarian is low; egg shell powder is the best way to go for it), Taurine (for sleep), Magnesium Taurate/Malate (in daytime if you like) or simply take Magnesium Glycinate at night (for sleep aid, body recovery, calmness), Omega 3 (for brain health and energy levels) and perhaps Ubiquinol (energy, stress etc).

That is it. If you've any specific issues at present, that would a way better approach. It's also a bit of hit-and-try method. For most, magnesium glycinate and Taurine will work for sleep. Creatine, D3, Zinc etc will take care of hormones and energy.

B-Complex is a difficult terrain since there is whole issue of Methylated vs Unmethylated and Dosage, and whatnot. For that, you'll have to get blood tests done (Homocysteine initially) or else you'll have to try many options and gauge yourself minutely (that may lead to inadvertent negative effects if dosage is high or Methylated B vitamins don't suit you).

comment,mrdvu9l,1ki9htf,2,,,2,"Creatine itself does not directly cause hair loss, but there has been some confusion due to a single small study from 2009 that found increased levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT)‚Äîa hormone linked to hair loss in genetically predisposed individuals‚Äîafter creatine supplementation.

Here‚Äôs the key context:

DHT and hair loss: DHT is known to shrink hair follicles in people with androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness).

The 2009 study: Involved rugby players and showed a 40% increase in DHT levels after 3 weeks of creatine loading. However, no actual hair loss was measured or reported.

No follow-up studies: No strong or consistent evidence since then has replicated this effect.

Bottom line: If you're genetically predisposed to pattern baldness, creatine might theoretically accelerate the process‚Äîbut there is no solid proof. If you‚Äôre not predisposed, it‚Äôs unlikely to have an effect.",Change1964,1746777515.0,,,,

comment,mrdvydz,1ki9htf,2,,,3,"There has been a significant follow-up study addressing the potential link between creatine supplementation and hair loss. 

üß™ 2024 Randomized Controlled Trial

A 12-week randomized controlled trial published in 2024 directly examined the effects of creatine on hair health and hormone levels.  The study found no significant differences between the creatine and placebo groups in terms of: 

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels

DHT-to-testosterone ratio

Hair growth parameters, including hair density and thickness 


These findings suggest that creatine supplementation does not contribute to hair loss  .

üîç Context from the 2009 Study

The concern about creatine and hair loss originated from a 2009 study involving college-aged rugby players.  This study reported a 56% increase in DHT levels after 7 days of creatine loading, with levels remaining 40% above baseline after 14 days of maintenance.  However, the study did not assess actual hair loss, and subsequent research has not replicated these hormonal changes  .

‚úÖ Conclusion

Current evidence indicates that creatine supplementation does not cause hair loss.  The initial concerns were based on hormonal changes observed in a single study, which have not been confirmed by later research.  Therefore, for most individuals, creatine is considered safe concerning hair health.

I remember being dumb when starting out with NMN and resveratrol and buying it on Ali. One of the two supplements arrived and tasted like sweet starch. I believe they thought sweet potato starch or something similar was just like resveratrol. They sent nicotinamide instead of NMN.

NMN at the time was very expensive, around 1000$ per kg of real stuff whereas this was much cheaper. The vendor all but admitted it and ended up refunding me. 

With all that said, it's possible it was contaminated with something or even just moisture. Creatine is quite cheap so there's little incentive to cheat you directly.

Sort of.

I think you're still confusing ""survival "" and ""optimal"". Organisms try to survive, despite the environment. They make do with what they can.

Somehow people have this romantic idea our ancestors are a perfect picture of health who enjoyed long lives. Some might, if they are rich, but many don't. 

People in Japan during the Samurai period had pretty short lifespans, due to widespread B12 deficiency due to being poor and consume mostly rice. 

[Vitamin deficiencies in rice-eating populations. Effects of B-vitamin supplements ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6357847/)

>It's like somebody saying a lion doesn't get enough nutrients from it's prey's meat and need a supplement for something found in fish.

Organisms can still survive despite being deficient. And working on your example about animals, there's a very obvious difference between animals in the wild vs animals in zoos or pets. Like animals in zoo, they are often times given supplements included in their food. Or pets given supplements. 

In wild a lion will probably barely consume any omega 3 or say magnesium, but with a good diet and care lions in zoos can live much longer and healthier.

That's where we at now. We are no longer scrounging for food. In the past, women especially consume bits of dirt for health (not knowing that it's for minerals  like iron). And I would say a majority of people in this sub are trying to optimise their health, not just surviving.

Of course the modern diet is wildly different from our ancestors. Like processed food is so much more common now. Plus a lot of our food are not less nutrient dense due to agricultural practices that deplete minerals in the soil. And husbandry practices where chickens and cows etc are fed with homogenous diet like just corn or grass and given lots of antibiotics.",jonoave,1746806691.0,,,,

Yes, below is a summary from GPT. Take time and do a little more research. Search Agmatine on Reddit for tons of anecdotal experiences. Go low and slow at first, some people find they are very sensitive to things that affect NO pathways.

Agmatine supports cognition, mood, and pain relief by modulating NMDA, nitric oxide, and monoamine pathways. It may also boost workouts, protect neurons, and reduce tolerance to drugs and supplements. 

Agmatine may help reduce cannabis tolerance by modulating NMDA receptors and nitric oxide pathways. It can support CB1 receptor sensitivity and lower the dose needed for THC effects. Typical dose: 250‚Äì500‚ÄØmg 30‚Äì60‚ÄØmin before use.",fosterfire3,1746758555.0,,,,

I have never ever heard this. I don't know what's going on with you but methylfolate and b12 do not affect the lungs. More likely your lungs are still recovering due to your flu, even if the virus is fought off. You need to give you body a chance to heal.¬†


If you can, get your Vitamin D3 blood level tested. You may be depleted since you had to fight an infection. You want to aim for 50-70 ng/mL but at least get it above 40. Get Serum Zinc, Serum Copper and Ceruloplasmin tested also and aim for the middle/upper-middle of the ref range.¬†


Maybe take a little Vitamin C for a while, but the above ideally you should test before supplementing.¬† ¬†


Active folate is literally the cornerstone of my depression stack, along with B12, B6, Vitamin C and ideally B2. By itself it doesn't cause depression. I don't know what's going on with you but it isn't causing lung trouble.",ftr-mmrs,1746757877.0,,,,

Anyone experienced this?",0.79,,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my experience with high-dose vitamin D supplementation and see if anyone has had similar issues.

I‚Äôm 30, male, relatively healthy. About 6 weeks ago, my vitamin D level was around (~21 ng/mL), so I started supplementing with: ‚Ä¢	10,000 IU vitamin D3 daily ‚Ä¢	200 mcg vitamin K2 (MK-7) ‚Ä¢	400 mg magnesium citrate

After 6 weeks, my new labs showed vitamin D at 161 nmol/L (~64 ng/mL), so it definitely went up fast. ( living in Germany with shy sun )

But here‚Äôs the problem: Around week 3, I started having serious issues: ‚Ä¢	Frequent heart palpitations (both VES and SVES) ‚Ä¢	Episodes of heart rhythm irregularities, racing pulse at rest ‚Ä¢	Strong inner restlessness, anxiety-like symptoms ‚Ä¢	And weirdly ‚Äì I got a bad cold, which never happens to me. ‚Üí During my deficiency, I had a rock-solid immune system for years, didn‚Äôt get sick once. Now suddenly I was down for days.

Bloodwork: ‚Ä¢	Magnesium was in normal range (0.77 mmol/L) ‚Ä¢	Potassium and calcium within normal ranges ‚Ä¢	No major electrolyte red flags, but still this sudden cardiac sensitivity and immune drop-off

I‚Äôve now stopped all supplements immediately, but I‚Äôm still dealing with the aftereffects. Anyone else had this kind of response to high-dose vitamin D? Could the rapid increase or over-supplementation cause this kind of systemic reaction?

Appreciate any feedback or similar experiences ‚Äì this stuff really threw me off.

comment,mrdp8tz,1ki3cg3,3,,,0,"Vitamin A is an important nutrient for pulmonary immunity. High dose VD without VA to go along is going to produce functional VA deficiency. If i could find the study i read last year, I'd include a link to it. But the key takeaway is that either of those vitamins becomes toxic if taken in very high doses without the other. 

Vitamin A's activator is zinc. Increasing zinc may have improved your vitamin A situation in that context, just a guess.

Also, high vitamin D may have put demands on your riboflavin dependant enzymes and, therefore, your B2 status. Since B2 is protective of lungs, the competitive demands of those oil soluble vitamins may have permitted the cold while suffering weakened protection. Riboflavin in higher amounts than the rda can bring benefits. It seems so far to be a vitamin that a person can safely exceed the rda and enjoy greater benefits  up to around 10 mg, they say. Meanwhile, migraine sufferers may take 400mg doses. Just sayin' there's room to go higher with B2's lung protection. 

As for the heart arrhythmia, and in the light of a normal calcium and magnesium panel, I'd look at the citrate ligand. Heart arrhythmias usually point to a magnesium problem. The citrate version is known to cause gut (muscle) cramping. In fact, only a couple of versions I've taken do not cause some sort of cramping. The heart is also a muscle.

Therefore, reconsider taking muscle friendly ligands bound to the magnesium such as bisglycinate, glycinate, or taurate. See to it that they aren't contaminated or even deliberately mixed with magnesium oxide. In Canada,  since 8 years ago, you can trust the ingredients list. You might have to experiment a bit to verify the non-cramping or palpitations of those I've recommended. I'm only one person. But I'm also listening to others.

Besides considering cofactor interactions as mentioned, you seem to be a person who has good VD support gene expression. It may be a sign to cut back when your blood levels rise quickly.",anniedaledog,1746773375.0,,,,

comment,mrdrr6b,1ki33zu,1,,,0,"Hey, I took a long time writing this for another guy kind of talking about similar things in your post. I am just going to copy and paste it below for you.

--------------‚Äê-------

Alrighttt, friend. After writing for an extended time.. I have a comprehensive list to meet your criteria.

A great starting point is lion‚Äôs mane mushroom. It‚Äôs been researched for its ability to support brain cell regeneration and help with focus over time. Brands like Real Mushrooms and Host Defense are solid choices, they are very clean. Take it on an empty stomach in the morning to get the most from it. If your thoughts tend to race like myn or you are feeling overstimulated. You could pair it with L-theanine, it can totally help smooth things out. It works especially well if you drink coffee, calming the nervous energy while keeping you alert. I'd go with thorne on this one. Super clean and tested!

Also, when libido or energy levels start to feel off, tongkat ali is a herb worth considering. It‚Äôs been shown to naturally support testosterone production and physical vitality. Lost Empire Herbs makes a very high integrity version. It‚Äôs best taken earlier in the day with a rotation schedule. Like five days on, two off, can really help keeping it effective over time. Zinc is another vital piece of the puzzle. It plays a direct role in hormone balance and immune defense. Thorne is also my go 2 for this! Evening is a good time to take it, ideally with food, but steer clear of pairing it with dairy or calcium heavy meals, since they compete with each other for absorption. But, truthfully.. I don't supplement zinc, copper, or selenium as you can get recommend daily amount of these important thyroid healthy nuts from 1 tbsp raw pumpkin seeds, 1 tbsp sunflower seeds, 2 tbsp of cashews and 1 brazil nut.

If you‚Äôre trying to feel more emotionally steady or manage stress better, ashwagandha has potential to help. (Though,  keep in mind, its ideal to rotate 6 weeks on, 2-3 weeks off) Especially in concentrated forms like KSM-66. It‚Äôs known to promote a sense of calm and improve how your body deals with stress over time. Gaia Herbs and Organic India are two companies that keep their formulas clean and transparent from what Ive been able to find. Evening dose with food can prep your body. Magnesium glycinate is another strong ally here, it supports your nervous system and can make it easier to unwind and fall asleep. You‚Äôll get the most benefit taking it about an hour before bed, away from a big meal. Id go for thorne or Seeking Health for the magnesium. Pure encapsulations makes super pure magnesium but they are owned by nestle and i don't support child labor. Haha

For better sleep overall, glycine is a simple amino acid that can make a real difference. Around 3 grams before bed can help your body cool down and enter deeper sleep without that foggy, sedated feeling the next morning. Thorne offers a very clean version of this. Can safely be taken alongside magnesium making for a calming, restorative nighttime routine to heal that body. ‚ù§Ô∏è

When it comes theart, brain,  eye, and joint health is where omega 3s shine. High quality fish oil from Nordic Naturels, especially in the more absorbable triglyceride forrm can 100% lower inflammation and keep your system running smoothly. Take it with a meal that includes healthy fat, (eggs, avacado) preferably breakfast or lunch. Vitamin D3 +K2 is another core nutrient that supports immune balance, hormones, and bone strength. K2 also helps spread calcium to your bones more evenly. Thorne is my go 2 on this. Early morning with breakfast is ideal as it can interfere with sleep.

To stay strong and support muscle recovery, creatine monohydrate is the most well resewrched and useful additions you can make. It helps with physical energy and brain function. Always look for the Creapure label from brands like Thorne. A daily 3‚Äì5 gram dose, taken after workouts or with a meal that is high in carbs, is usually ideal. If your diet occasionally falls short on protein, using a clean powder from Garden of Life can help fill in the gaps and keep your muscles fueled and recovering well.

Digestive health often gets overlooked, but it‚Äôs foundational.  Can help your gut stay balanced and support everything from mood to immune defense. Taking a probiotic 30mins to 1hr before breakfast or right before bed. I love the organically certified ancient nutrition probiotic.

Not a doctor but in my experience anxiousness does tire your brain way more youd think. start off with the basics magnesium, potassium, zinc. You might be ingesting fluids all day but without these vital minerals,absorption of fluids are super low.  Now i dont experience highs and lows in terms of energy its a constant more relaxed alert state. Daily I used to drink 4-6 cups of coffee just to get by, now i cant touch any without getting jitters, fast heart rate and anxiousness. I take 400mg magnesium glycinate, anywhere from 2000mg -3000mg potassium and a lil 50 mg Zinc/copper/iodine pill. start off simple and see how you feel, grab some coconut water, a banana and a pinch of salt and see if you feel any difference with these added electrolytes .

comment,mrcw10i,1ki2rdc,1,,,4,"Dang! I thought we possibly had a good culprit for your daytime sleepiness but I guess not lol. Not to worry, you will solve this puzzle. 

Just a note: Melatonin can help with sleep onset but may leave some people groggy, especially at higher doses like 3mg. Id drop down to 1mg or as low as .3mg and see how you respond. 

Apart from that 
 Id say we can narrow the possible causes to these categories:

- Insufficient sleep quality. 
Even with good sleep duration, the quality of sleep, underlying deficiencies, or imbalances in stress response can play a role. 

- A chronic condition like anemia, thyroid issues, or diabetes. 
 
- or mental health factors such as your anxiety. When your body spends energy being anxious that's going fo deplete you fast and leave you feeling drained. I have no doubt that this is at least part where your fatigue is stemming from. 

If I were you, I'd get the labs done (sounds like you are), get a sleep study and try some supplements in the meantime to help cope with the anxiety like L-theanine, Ashwaganda and/or magnesium glycinate. (These have the most clinical evidence supporting their efficacy).

For fatigue you could do B12/b-complex vitamin and Vitamin D3.

comment,mrbl7ec,1ki28c8,1,,,0,"One possibility is that the increase in calcium is interfering with zinc absorption, which is important for sexual function.

Did they explain why they are having you take calcium? Vitamin D helps to absorb calcium, so unless you have some specific issue, or you don't have enough calcium in your diet for some reason, then you really don't need a calcium supplement.",VitaminDJesus,1746741801.0,,,,

comment,mrf7o1t,1ki28c8,1,,,4,"I would be remiss if I didn't inquire about vitamin k2. When taking a calcium supplement vitamin d pulls it into the blood stream. Vitamin k2 pulls it from the blood stream into bones. Without the k2 the calcium will bind with cholesterol and clog your arteries. 

This is pretty new dietary knowledge. Definitely wasn't floating around ten years ago when you got on your regimen.

comment,mrb9po9,1ki0q8q,1,,,0,"Sorry to tell you this, but supplements like this - ones that contain a blend of both highly bioavailable minerals and minerals that have a much Lower bioavailability minerals are usually a scam. Supplements and food need to list ingredients in order of amount. So there is more magnesium bisglycinate than there is magnesium oxide, but it's probably something like 51%. And the reason that they do this is because oxide is extremely low in bioavailability, but it's also much much cheaper. 200 milligrams is the total amount of magnesium in the supplement, but it will actually probably be much lower because of the blend of two magnesiums, one of which is not absorbed very well.

submission,1ki0mdo,,6,Saffron anxiety instead of joy,0.87,,"TL;DR - Has anyone experienced saffron causing them anxiety instead of joy? It sounds so much better in other people's glowing reviews.

Hello all,

I started to take saffron last week. I have taken it 3 times in total, thinking it could be a mood booster. Lately, I have been a little anxious because \*gestures broadly\*. I am in school at the moment and have been having a bit of difficulty locking in when I study, and I attributed that to my anxiety.

The first time I took saffron, I had a bit of tingling all over my body and a lot of energy that I was able to use to study in a very focused way for about 6 hours. I felt like I found my miracle.

The second time, I took saffron about 20 minutes before I intended on studying, and I spent about 5 hours focusing on the world at large, overthinking, and super anxious. I kept my schoolwork on my computer, but my anxiety was so bad that I couldn't focus or shift my attention away from worldly problems.

The third time I took saffron was today. I took it intending to study, but instead, I have been overthinking, anxious, and thinking about my high school reunion in October, and how everyone would know I was a failure. I couldn't even talk myself out of these thoughts until I stepped back and realized I was fine all day - had a productive half day at work, ate a nice lunch, had a good laugh with a friend on the phone, and felt generally good all day until I took saffron.

I think nootropics might not be the best for me, as ashwagandha makes me irrationally angry, and apparently, saffron makes me anxious.

Has anyone had a similar experience with saffron? I only see glowing reviews about how it makes the sun shine brighter in people's lives.",Tr0ncatlady,1746736775.0,4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1ki0mdo/saffron_anxiety_instead_of_joy/

submission,1khuo0q,,120,Please don't take Methylated vitamins without testing or consulting your doctor.,0.88,,"Over 8 months ago I started taking a methylated b supplement with extremely high doses of methylb12 and methylfolate. I've been in a constant state of fight or flight and anxiety for months and I had no idea why. At first I thought dissociation disorder because I have dissociated under extreme stress a lot, and I had all these fanciful theories as to what was going on but I never expected it to be part of my supplement stack destroying me.

My theory (I would like some comments from people who know more than me) is that I had a normal methylation cycle that I pushed into overmethylation through over supplementation of methyl donors such as the aforementioned complex or even my 5g of creatine every day. This created a weird neurotransmitter imbalance due to how methylation and B vitamins affect neurotransmitter production and re-uptake, and caused brief psychosis, paranoia, anxiety and eventually (due to down-regulation of dopamine reward pathways due to too much dopamine) complete apathy and depression.

As for me, I have been taking niacin every day in small increments but I haven't gotten much better. I would love some advice or at least a timeline or an explanation as to whats going on here as well as a word on whether or not I might have changed gene expressions related to methylation and the long term implications of this.

I do not have any genetic testing as to what my MTHFR or COMT genes are, so this is all speculation, however I beg of you do not experiment with things without at least having an idea of what you are doing and the consequences - and more importantly getting real testing and advice from a doctor who knows what they are doing.

comment,mrfeuad,1khuo0q,3,,,0,"I think the issue here is the ""extremely high doses"" part (as opposed to the methylated part).  900mcg of B12 methylcobalmin  is pretty extreme, particularly when compared to the others.  For example, B12 has a direct impact on heart and B6 and folate help control blood pressure.  The methylated vitamin I have has a 0.003 ratio of B12 to B6 and a 0.45 ratio of B12 to folate, while yours has a B12:B6 and B12:folate ratios which are 15x and 3x mine.

Also, maybe more profoundly, while a B12 deficiency can cause high heart rate, too much B12 will definitely cause a high heart rate.  And a persistently high heart rate that never gets to be calm is a hallmark of panic disorders.

Bottom-line: methylated vitamins just get to skip the methylation biochemical steps that break down more common forms, allowing your body to actually process more of them before they are excreted.

comment,mrgbk6b,1khuo0q,4,,,0,"If you struggle with feeling anxious or overstimulated, or even just not right after starting methylated B vitamins, it's likely the methylfolate or methylcobalamin.. you‚Äôre definitely not alone. Some people, including several of my clients, especially those with certain genetic traits like MTHFR or COMT variants, don‚Äôt process methyl donors efficiently. This can lead to an overload of methylation, which may throw off your neurotransmitter balance. It‚Äôs not uncommon at all for this to trigger symptoms like paranoia, heightened anxiety, insomnia, and even emotional numbness or apathy. One big mistake people make is jumping in to these high dosed methylated vitamins thinking more is better.. especially without any lab testing or guidance from a knowledgeable practitioner. In some cases, stacking these with creatine ,another methyl donor can contribute to only adding fuel to the fire.

If you‚Äôre in this boat, a safer, more foundational approach to B vitamins is to stick with lower doses, ideally use non methylated or moderately methylated forms. A balanced B complex that includes P5P (activated B6), niacinamide (non-flushing B3), riboflavin (B2), and pantothenic acid (B5) can be a good starting point. If you do try folate or B12, look for smaller doses, some where around like 200 mcg of methylfolate or 250 mcg of methylcobalamin. Rather than megadoses, and consider taking them just a 3-5 times a week instead of daily. Niacinamide or even a low dose of flushing niacin can sometimes help calm the effects of too much methylation, though it‚Äôs not considered a quick fix.

At the end of the day, everyone‚Äôs methylation needs are different. That‚Äôs why I would recommend genetic or organic acid test, or working with a functional medicine provider, can save you a lot of confusion. It‚Äôs not about avoiding B vitamins entierely.

comment,mremp3h,1khuo0q,2,,,0,"Reading your post, I wanted to point out two things, that could be related to why you developed the symptoms you mention.

1. Supplementing only methylcobalamin without adenosylcobalamin in the quantity you‚Äôve done, could potentially push you into a cellular B12 deficiency, which can cause an array of horrible symptoms. Unlike cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin, which both can be converted into the two active forms of B12 in the body; methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, the active forms can‚Äôt be converted into each other in the body. Both active forms are essentiel for the function of your body, hence its impotant to supplement both, when supplementing in the dosages you‚Äôve been doing it.

2. Some experts advise against supplementing B6 in dosages of 20 mg or higher, since its been seen causing b6 toxicity. Even though b-vitamins are watersolulable, B6 has a half life much longer than the other B-vitamins making it susceptible to build up in the body causing toxicity. By supplementing with P5P the risk should be reduced, but the risk is still there.

I took Douglas Laboratories 1000mcg drops for many years without issues. Labs would show high B12 but OK.

Past month I did the mistake of starting Metagenics PhytoMulti when I had also recently begun taking Codeage Methylfolate B Complex +. I thought the Codeage supplement was a good idea to replace the B12 drops and increase slightly the folate. Such mistake. I have diagnosed adrenal fatigue and I began having very severe adrenal crashes (it has been 10 years since I felt anything like that). Only when I stopped taking both did I feel better. However I am still having severe insomnia that also begun about that time.

I am taking now Whole Earth & Sea¬Æ, Women's Multivitamin & Mineral, which is OK, but as I am still not recovering from the severe insomnia, I have reduced to just one tablet in the morning.

comment,mrmdwcb,1khuo0q,2,,,0,"You have to start slowly and titer up the dosages and you also have to add other vitamins and nutrients because too much folate and B12 too soon will throw your system out of whack, including lowering your potassium levels. It's possible that low potassium is causing your anxiety. You also must include the adenosylcobalamin form of B12. What looks like over methylation can often be a deficiency state. Check out Freddd's Protocol. This has helped many people (including me) get their folate and B12 levels up using the methylated forms and also adenosylcobalamin and all the nutrients cofactors for support.¬†


It sounds like you don't actually know if you are low in folate or B12 or any of the other B's, and even though many people have the MTHFR snp you don't know if you have it. Either way, if you want to try increasing your levels to see if it helps, use Freddd's Protocol. Of course, it's always best to find a good naturopath or functional medicine doctor for testing and protocols.",Carrie_likes_health,1746899181.0,,,,

Interestingly, taking methylated B12 doesn't give your cells methylated B12. The methyl donor is cut off the cobalamin (B12) early on and the pieces are used for different things, with your body making a methyl donor later to put with the cobalamin. It's like how protein is broken down into amino acids then those are put together to send protein to muscles, etc. They found the main difference in the 3 main types of B12 was just how long it took us to get rid of it in urine.",Dez2011,1746737473.0,,,,

Drinking beer may reduce excessive vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) levels from over-supplementation in a few indirect ways, but it's not a medically recommended method for managing B6 toxicity. Here's how it might work:

1. Alcohol interferes with B6 metabolism: Chronic alcohol consumption impairs the absorption and storage of vitamin B6 and accelerates its breakdown in the liver. Alcohol can increase the activity of liver enzymes that degrade B6, leading to lower levels in the body.


2. Increased urinary excretion: Alcohol acts as a diuretic, which can increase the excretion of water-soluble vitamins like B6 in the urine. This might slightly reduce excess circulating B6 levels.


3. Liver stress and nutrient depletion: The liver uses vitamin B6 in detoxification pathways. When it‚Äôs stressed by alcohol, it may use up more B6, which could reduce circulating levels.",UnapproachableBadger,1747135662.0,,,,

Last year my result was 3 something and all the other years before that it was 2 something. It is to be noted that I also have vitamin D and ferritin deficiency, and normal low B12 like 200 something. I also barely sleep (I like to stay up late and sleep in, also my cat keeps waking me up)  and currently lead a pretty sedentary lifestyle. So, I know all these factors can affect TSH levels. I decided to take all these supplements and change my lifestyle completely, but also went to the doctor as well. She told me to get more tests, and gave me the three supplement plus magnesium and one supplement that contains 83 mcg selenium and 600 mg myo-inositol. Results came back, T3 is 2.75 pg/mL and T4 is 1.15 ng/dL and Anti-TPO is 19 IU/ml.  I told her, she told me, they're good and to just do the supplement plan she gave me.

I am currently taking everything except the selenium/myo-inositol one because I just wanted to understand more. Is it okay if I take it, with my results? Will it affect anything else badly? Is it okay to take it when I dont have PCOS or insulin resistance. and my glucose levels are really good. What if I already get enough selenium from my diet and dont have deficiencies for either? And what if my elevated TSH levels are just purely circumstantial and I can lower them with the other supplements and lifestyle changes?

comment,mrjt3va,1khndcn,1,,,0,"100% snake oil and 100% BS. 

""Growth"" requires actual physical stimulus. No powder or pill or liquid or gel is going to ""grow"" anything. Some supplements that improve blood flow, cardiovascular health, nitric oxide processing, etc. can give the illusion of growth, but it's going to be purely due to better erections and it will NOT be anywhere near 3 inches. Remember the time when some belts with mere heating pads in them used to claim they'd magically melt away subcutaneous fat? Yeah, it's the same thing. 

If anybody wants to gain actual physical size, the only way to do that is through specific exercises and using tools such as hangers, extenders, pumps... And these methods are NOT RISK-FREE. People have injured or permanently ruined their penis by using these techniques and tools without proper guidance and technique. So this isn't a joyride one could suddenly hop on one fine Sunday morning. It's tough work that requires consistency and effort.

Nope, this stuff has been incredible for me and my partner. I‚Äôve always had a high libido and never had an issue with erection quality and I‚Äôve always been a leaky faucet so that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm taking it. My issue has been penile sensitivity. I recently switched to a nicer more moisturizing body wash with 6% hyaluronic acid and after a week I noticed my head was slightly more sensitive. It sent me down a rabbit hole and I came across some anecdotal threads on here and looked more into it with ChatGPT deep research so I took the plunge. I noticed effects day 1, I literally came in under 10 minutes (usually take 15-30+ depending how much I‚Äôm teased) and was ready to go again shortly after. After a week I woke up one morning and a single touch through my boxers made me cum instantly without warning. I‚Äôm about two weeks in now and my gf and I noticed I was considerably thicker. The whole time I‚Äôve been becoming more sensitive and the sensations are way more pleasurable. We‚Äôve been having a lot of fun. This has legit impacted us in a way I never expected. Very powerful stuff, will be permanent in my stack. I also notice more natural energy as well and have almost completely cut out caffeine.

I have not noticed any change in my libido personally.

I do like life extension and solgar supplements for the ones I don‚Äôt get through food as easily, like vitamin E at this time.

I find I have a hard time breaking down gel capsules in food, so if it‚Äôs an encapsulated powder (nothing delayed release, that isn‚Äôt safe) I open them up to stir in my morning protein drink (with respect to what else is in it/abroption competition, for this reason I take have a vegan protein powder and drink it in a juice I make myself of mostly green veggies and antioxidant fruits that I‚Äôll have with eggs and spicy rice as milk and dairy compete with a lot of vitamins for absorption)

I think Now is the best value for money.  I've never had an issue with their products. If they don't have exactly what I'm looking for, then I move on to the other brands. I occasionally buy stuff from Thorne, and they may be great, but they are expensive. I also tend to take singular supplements, not proprietary formulations, so maybe it's worth the extra money if that's what you're looking for.

Eta, I also use Sports Research, specifically their fish oil. I was using Nordic Naturals, but once again, it seems like a value for money things.

Suppliments is actually kinda foreign to the body...because nutrient mostly rely on co factors (as is found in foods) to help with absorbtion...
Also, we don't really know what the real state of the body is...which is needed an which not. Sometimes some nutrient shows low, but the problem is at another nutrient. 
Vitamins and Minerals are very co dependent on each other. They all have an influence on each other.

comment,mrhc4mw,1khmnil,1,,,0,"I trust different brands with different things.

**Edubily** \- 3rd party test each batch, ultra clean and pure, basically the most risk-free supplements to buy. But their philosophy may not work for everyone (they tend to low dose everything) plus they're weird about international shipping. Also reduced frequency of lab tests in the past few years, and continue claiming their Omega 3 has better quality than it does.

[Glucosamine.com](http://Glucosamine.com) has some lab results, and some outstanding products that I trust.

**Naturelo**, **Vitaminexpress, Sunday** and **Seeking Health** \- their formulations are much closer to my personal preference, but they don't share any lab results (except Sunday for a handfull out of their incredibly vast catalogue, and I've heard Seeking Health provides them upon request), so quality is difficult to judge. But based on all the information available about them, I think it's likely that their products are decent quality. 

**Life Extension** \- I trust their quality control, and that their products include what's on the label. Their formulation philosophy isn't super close to my preferences, but I find them great for punctual, specific products that just work. iHerb/California Gold is 99% just copying their products. I have a similar attitude towards **Supersmart**.

Others like **NOW** or **HSN**, I trust with patented ingredients, and simple single ingredients. 

One supplement where quality control and a brand's attitude to quality and science is easy to observe is Omega 3 (Fish or Algae Oil).",mxlila,1746823228.0,,,,

I‚Äôve been searching for a high-quality multivitamin that isn‚Äôt overloaded with B vitamins, especially B6 and B12. I was thinking of trying Pure Encapsulations or Thorne, but they seem to have too high values, I don‚Äôt understand how people take them everyday without any negative affects to their body. The B-complex doses in these are sometimes over 1000% daily value or 25000% b12 which is crazy) 

I‚Äôm looking for something:
- High-quality (clean ingredients, 3rd party tested if possible)

- Reasonable B-vitamin doses (especially B6, B12, folate) 

- Preferably without iron

Anyone found a good multivitamin that fits this profile?

comment,mr8mx7f,1khgsak,1,,,0,"For anxiety, Phosophatidylserine does help so does L-Glycine. Some people take NAC along with L-Glycine for issues related to anxiety. If you sleep cycle is fine, then perhaps stay on the same regimen for a week or so and then evaluate. There are also herbs for anxiety, but can't say if they work or much. Plus you don't want to take them if you're on SSRIs. So you'll have to choose your options carefully to avoid any potential interactions. L-Theanine can help with focus (but may interfere with sleep in some people) and its half life is quite short. There are various options offers by Nootropics Depot like Sabroxy. You can post in their subreddit for suggestions as well. Best of Luck!

i was fed up and got prescribed add meds to hopefully finally fix this issue, it definitely worked but instead i got into a 6 year problem with substances and heavy use‚Ä¶

i got the meds to hopefully help and instead i was immediately hooked, and it opened to door for me to try many, manyyy other substances. i had 0 intentions to abuse it when being prescribed‚Ä¶ 

so now the ADD is worse, im currently in the mist of trying to quit all hard the stuff, but my memory and focus and motivation is worse than ever.

the problem is if i read something, like subtitles, or any text/book, or playing a game and reading the text. i will read it over and over and over again. a 45 minute episode on a show takes me around 5-6 hours to watch, not even kidding because i constantly skip back over and over every 5 seconds (literally) and watch the same scene dozens of times, seriously will watch it over and over, sometimes 5 times, some times 20

every time i watch it i immediately forget what they just said and it doesn‚Äôt stick in my brain for longer than a second so i can‚Äôt really process what there saying even after watching the same thing a million times. there are many reasons i can‚Äôt focus when watching shows, the substances also make me overly exciting so i want to take in every detail and all that, but this issue is one of the main ones, im tired of this and have been thinking of trying nootropics / noop stacks for this problem and just motivation/mood and it‚Äôs other benefits in general. 

im getting desperate to get anything to help me be able to focus that‚Äôs not going back to ADD meds and do literally anything without having to be explained 10 times or watch a scene in some game or show over and over ",monkDshanks,1746663761.0,5,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1khcxpd/nootropics_and_supplements_to_help_boost_your/

comment,mr5om8v,1khahk6,1,,,0,"Holistic physician Dr Cass Ingram says the panic attacks are strongly linked to adrenal exhaustion, blood sugar imbalances, and  hormonal dysfunction.

Supporting adrenal function naturally is key because often trauma and highly stressful experiences damage the adrenal gland. 

Here are some recommended approaches based on Dr. Ingram‚Äôs articles and books:

	adrenal gland support - you can take Dr Cass Ingrams Body Shape Diet Adrenal Support Formula supplement and 
Take herbs like:

submission,1kh912h,,0,Methylforms making me depressed and anxious,0.5,,"I have had a folic acid deficiency for a long time - vitamin b12 is in the medium range. I have now tried various supplements and have come to the following conclusion:



I have tried a complex product 



a vitamin b12 product with these ingredients



Vitamin B12 500¬µg	

Methylcobalamin 166¬µg	

Hydroxocobalamin 166¬µg	

Adenosylcobalamin 166¬µg	



and this folic acid product 



Folic acid (5-MTHF) 400¬µg



So I took these two products in the evening and about 6 hours later I started to feel very restless with palpitations. I then went to sleep and when I woke up in the morning I was very depressed, anxious, restless, had a rapid pulse, mild hallucinations, my body felt warm and was burning. I'm pretty sure it was from the products. I have to say that I react very sensitively to a number of medications and it took me a long time to find a suitable product, even with Omega 3. 



I wonder if it has something to do with MTHFR? (unfortunately I can't get a test at the moment - there are very few places in my country that do this and it's very expensive) 



In general, I deal with depression and compulsions - so I'm already pre-disposed. I should take folic acid as I have a deficiency, but I can't tolerate the methyl form... 



Any tips? ",uniquex1212,1746653002.0,13,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kh912h/methylforms_making_me_depressed_and_anxious/

submission,1kh5t5n,,1,Does NAC affect Vyvanse?,0.67,,"So I switched to vyvanse from adderall for my adhd. I take a single 20mg dose in the morning.

Vyvanse is essentially just sustained release dextroamphetamine versus adderall which is a mix of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine. Between the two, vyvanse is a much more slow and sustained ‚Äúburn‚Äù which isn‚Äôt as forced and is much more general purpose for the focus it produces me.

Adderall has some anecdotal evidence to have an interaction with N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine(NAC) in such a way that it may have slightly reduced effects. However NAC helps control impulsivity, promotes better mood, reduces depression, and seems to have some good effects for multiple mental health conditions. It also has a good anti-inflammatory and I believe some antioxidant effects which can be helpful for pain relief among other things.

However I couldn‚Äôt find much info on the interaction between vyvanse/dextroamphetamine and NAC. However that doesn‚Äôt mean that no interaction exists and I was wondering if anyone might know if there‚Äôs reduced effectiveness by taking both.

I am also taking L-Tyrosine, a B-complex, fish oil, vitamin D, turmeric curcumin, ginkgo biolba, potassium(as needed), and I use ashwaganda in cycles of 1 month on, 1-2 off.

I also take L-Theanine occasionally but I also drink green tea so I don‚Äôt always supplement it. 

At night I use valerian root extract as a sleep aid too.

I have taken NAC when taking breaks from my medication. I personally prefer to not increase dose of meds, but rather take a break to reset tolerance. During these periods of not taking meds, I notice it helps me improve my impulsiveness and I have a subtle but noticeable improvement of mindfulness.

Given I haven‚Äôt found any interactions with vyvanse I am interested in trying to add NAC back to my stack. But since it does have some reports of interacting with adderall, I wanted to see what other people have experienced or might know about the mixing of vyvanse and NAC",PsychonauticResearch,1746645148.0,1,General Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kh5t5n/does_nac_affect_vyvanse/

comment,mr3nmab,1kh2zpd,2,,,0,"AS a coach who works with SO many people who come to me with this presentation, here are some things to consider:

1. Obviously, there is the calorie consideration. if you're in a deficit, that would be a driver and honestly is something you might just have to deal with for a period of time (and why I don't have people chronically operate in a deficit)
2. Those types of classes can create a lot of fatigue on the body in addition to the rest of your activity. And while initially you were able to handle it, over time that can compound. Then add on life stress (intense job, kids, etc), Type A/go-go type personality, improper/inadequate nutrition, poor sleep, etc and you are in the overfatigue and under-recoverd zone.

if that's the case (and tbh it sounds like it is), then having a short period of time where you pull that fatigue off, increase some calories, and NAIL sleep and stress, will have you feeling better in NO time. I call it an ""unwinding"" phase.

3. And this is a short-term solution, but some people have such a high CNS response from hard training that the subsequent crash is a little overaggressive. 

you might respond from either something that pulls that cortisol down a bit (like 1-2 cap of Chill factor by pure factor formulations) OR you might respond to some ""uppers"" like a little hit of caffeine, tyrosine, or alpha GPC, or something of the like to bump you up (I use these in people who are pushing hard in a deficit for a show or end of a fat loss phase to give them a mid day boost).

Hope that helps! But make sure you're paying attention to the signs and not continuing to push through (or at least for long periods of time). I see this so often and 99% of the time its just your system being overloaded and needing a pullback.",jackednleen,1746639412.0,,,,

comment,mr45ac7,1kh2kyz,1,,,0,"Sup man. Studies show that zinc and L-citrulline can work quite well together when it comes to supporting your workouts, energy, and sexual health. Taking five grams of L-citrulline daily will allow your body to increase nitric oxide levels, which can enhance your blood flow. That boost in circulation can lead to better endurance during training and a nice boost in the bedroom. Zinc plays a different but importan role. It's pretty essential for healthy testosterone levels, immune function, and overall vitality. If you‚Äôre low in zinc, bringing your levels up can make a real difference in how you feel, especially when it comes to energy and libido.

As for dosing, most people do well with fifteen to thirty milligrams of zinc per day, and it‚Äôs best not to go over forty milligrams unless you‚Äôre working with a doctor. Look for forms like zinc picolinate or citrate, which are way easier for your body to absorb. It‚Äôs also a good idea to take it with food to avoid any stomach issues. For something clean and reliable, I always recommend Thorne Zinc Picolinate to my clients. Its incredibly clean with out all that extra junk. Also, Kaged L-Citrulline is another great one. Putting both into your routine can be a simple, but smart way to support that body!

I‚Äôm a 26 year old male and have been seriously focused on improving my health and dropping weight over the past 6 months.

**I‚Äôd love your input:**

**1. What‚Äôs worth keeping?**

**2. What should I drop?**

**3. Anything you‚Äôd recommend I add?**

**Gym Support:**

submission,1kh0y3p,,23,"CBD oil has a bell-shaped curve for treating anxiety: studies find a single dose of 300 mg reduces anxiety, but lower or higher doses of 150 mg or 600 mg do not. Also, since CBD's half-life is long (a few days), dose reduction on subsequent days may be necessary in order to maintain peak effects",0.9,,"A¬†[study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6781714/)¬†observed that cannabidiol (CBD) has a bell-shaped dose-response curve for treating anxiety, and single doses of 300 mg reduced anxiety, but doses of 150 mg or 600 mg did not.

Another¬†[study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5425583/)¬†also observed that CBD has a bell-shaped dose-response curve for treating anxiety, and single doses of 300 mg reduced anxiety, but doses of 100 mg or 900 mg did not.

A¬†[review paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9841308/)¬†details 3 studies (in¬†[table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9841308/table/cts13425-tbl-0001/)) which used CBD doses of 100 to 150 mg, and found no anxiolytic effect, but lists 9 studies which found a positive effect for anxiety at doses of 300 mg or 400 mg. So again this indicates the sweet spot is around 300 mg daily.

A bell-shaped dose-response curve is also called an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve.

Note though that this¬†[study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6275223/)¬†says CBD has a half-life of 2 to 5 days with chronic oral administration. So when used daily, CBD will build up in the system, and thus in order to remain at the peak of the bell-shaped dose-response curve, 300 mg might be fine on the first day, but you may have to lower your dose on subsequent days.

The above two studies used single CBD doses to test its effects on anxiety during public speaking. These studies did not use continued daily dosing.

The exponential formula for calculating daily doses which takes account of the half life is:

**Daily dose = First day dose \* (1 - 0.5\^(1/L))**

where L is the half life in days. Assuming a half life of 3 days, we then get:

Daily dose = 300 \* (1 - 0.5\^(1/3)) = 300 \* 0.207 = 62 mg.

**So after taking 300 mg on the first day, on subsequent days you would take around 62 mg** as a top up, and this would keep you at the top of the bell-shaped curve.

As a complete aside, dozens of people have found [the supplement N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) pretty effective for their generalised anxiety disorder](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1i8pbxr/remarkably_powerful_antianxiety_effects_from_the/), and NAG has no tolerance build up.

comment,mr9ircd,1kh0y3p,1,,,0,"Note that because the CBD half-life is 2 to 5 days, depending on the person and the speed of their metabolism, the daily dose will be different for each person. In the first post, I calculated a daily dose of 62 mg based on an average half-life of 3 days. But in a give individual, the CBD half-life could be anywhere from 2 to 5 days.

The equation I quoted in the first post is:

**Daily dose = First day dose \* (1 - 0.5\^(1/L))**

where L is the half life in days.

Assuming a half life of 2 days, we then get: Daily dose = 300 \* (1 - 0.5\^(1/2)) =¬†**88 mg**.

But assuming a half life of 5 days, we then get: Daily dose = 300 \* (1 - 0.5\^(1/2)) =¬†**39 mg**.

So the daily dose might be anywhere from 39 to 88 mg, depending on the CBD half-life in a particular individual. But without lab testing, it would not be possible to know the half-life in a given person.

So in order to get the sweet spot for daily dosing, a person might start out at the lowest dose level, say **40 mg** daily, and try that for a week or two. Then increment the dose by say 15 mg up to **55 mg** daily, and try that for a couple of weeks. Then increment again to **70 mg**, and test that for a fortnight.

Such a bottle will thus have 12000 √∑ 30 = 400 mg of CBD per ml. Now normally 1 ml of oil will contain around 20 drops, so to get the dose per drop, we divide by 20, and that will be 400 √∑ 20 = 20 mg per drop.",Hip_III,1746637086.0,,,,

I am 21F and I have always dealt with pretty severe anxiety since a very young age. However, the past year has been especially tough for me. I try everything in my power to avoid anxiety medication because of its adverse effects so I took the holistic route with ashwagandha. After three weeks of consistent use I found myself spiraling over the smallest things (more than I usually do). I became extremely paranoid, cried frequently, and now have a crick in my neck from how tense I was the past few days. I stopped taking it today.

I typically suffer in silence with my anxiety so when I began to lash out to my loved ones with how stressed I was, I realized there was something very wrong. How can a supplement that is supposed to lower my cortisol levels somehow make me much, much worse. I am wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, and if there are any recommendations as to what I should take instead. I am running out of options and I refuse to get on Zoloft or anything of the sort...

It sounds like you just need to stop. 

There are definitely other alternatives and I actually have a bit of an anxiety stack that I take when work gets stressful or I feel terrible.

I take:

L-theanine, Kava, Magnesium, Rhodiola rhosea, Ashwagahnda. 

Works a treat every time. Try the others without ash.

Also, worth mentioning that you should try eliminating super commonly overlooked anxiety triggers. Alcohol, weed, caffeine.

Incorporate HIIT training 3 or 4 days a week, or even better try and do a session when you feel terrible. I know it's tough, but it's powerful.

comment,mr4g5ki,1kgximz,2,,,0,"Honestly, skip the typical suggestions like L-theanine ‚Äî it‚Äôs just as hit-or-miss as ashwagandha and comes with similar caveats. If you‚Äôre sensitive, it can make you more wired or jittery, not calmer. Before trying that, look into saffron.

Saffron isn‚Äôt just another trendy herb ‚Äî it actually has the data to back it up. Multiple clinical studies have shown saffron to be as effective as antidepressants like Prozac for anxiety and depression without the side effects. It also helps with sleep, mood regulation, and even PMS-related anxiety.

And unlike L-theanine, you don‚Äôt need to keep taking it throughout the day ‚Äî saffron works on deeper mechanisms and tends to have a cumulative effect, helping to rebalance rather than just temporarily suppress symptoms.

There‚Äôs a real argument to be made that saffron is one of the most powerful and universally tolerated supplements for mental health out there. It doesn‚Äôt get nearly enough attention, probably because it can‚Äôt be mass-produced as cheaply as some of the others.

Start low (around 15‚Äì30mg of standardized saffron extract per day), and give it a couple of weeks ‚Äî you‚Äôll likely feel a profound difference without the rollercoaster side effects",TechnicalDirector182,1746647619.0,,,,

If you‚Äôre still interested in the holistic route, you might want to try products that combine **Ashwagandha with L-theanine. it could potentially take the edge off** anxiety without causing those intense side effects.

Also, it‚Äôs super important to check that the ingredients you‚Äôre taking are clinically tested or standardised. Some ingredients, are more researched and tend to have more predictable effects.

comment,mrmbsbr,1kgximz,1,,,0,"Totally get where you‚Äôre coming from, ashwagandha doesn‚Äôt land well for everyone even though it‚Äôs hyped as a universal fix for anxiety, it works on modulating cortisol and GABA, and if your system‚Äôs already on edge or your constitution doesn‚Äôt match, it can amplify those exact symptoms it‚Äôs meant to help. Not uncommon at all.

You might want to look into herbs like **Malkangni (Celastrus paniculatus)** and **Brahmi (Bacopa monnieri)**. Both have pretty fascinating neuroprotective and anxiolytic profiles, but through different mechanisms than Ashwagandha.   
Malkangni‚Äôs shown in some neuropsychopharmacological reviews to improve cognitive resilience and calm nervous excitability, while Brahmi‚Äôs well-documented for reducing anxiety by regulating serotonin and stress response pathways in the brain.

comment,mr2wqt3,1kgwd6a,41,,,0,"100% this! I went from 15+ supplements to just 3 core ones (D3, magnesium, fish oil) and honestly feel way better.

comment,mr28g1f,1kgwd6a,42,,,0,"Without a doubt. You have nailed it here. I discovered this a while back, and up until then, like yourself I was quite the biohacker. I‚Äôve taken every supplement you‚Äôve heard of at some point. *No* supplement or stack has ever come close in any way to adequate sleep, bright light and staying active to me. And eating well. Those 4 things easily do 90% of the work, if not 95%. The other 5-10% could be achieved with a good stack but it‚Äôs so little in comparison. 

If you can get something from food, in my experience it‚Äôs always much more effective. Omega 3 for example, regardless of brand I never found much benefit. Nowadays I eat high quality salmon 3-4 times a week, never felt better. 


The one exception would be vitamin D3. certainly in winter, depending on where you live.

comment,mr2jjtl,1kgwd6a,3,,,0,"I agree 100%. My approach with my self and my clients has gone from ""whats the next best protcol"" and supplementing for every little deficiency to a really stripped back approach to supplementation. Hitting the big things that have big impacts on the body by working on a number of systems or a big issue like inflammation and oxidative stress.

I get as much as I can through food, manage stress, sleep 8+ hrs a night +  a few basics like Cod liver oil, magnesium, vit d/k, maybe creatine, black seed oil or curcumin, colostrum.

comment,mr4caik,1kgwd6a,2,,,0,"You only need to supplement if you are deficient in a specific nutrient. Way too much is just as bad as not enough if you have filled in the nutrient deficit and you have corrected your food intake to include a wide variety of needed nutritional value, you no longer need to supplement. If the symptoms that prompted you to originally take those supplements have disappeared you no longer need to supplement for that ailment. As long as you don't have a specific genetic defect keeping you from creating a specific nutrient I would see no reason to continue taking a specific nutrient for the rest of your life.

At least for me the ones I have taken long term are vitamin D3, vitamin K2, magnesium glycinate, gelatin - collagen. When I get sick I will take extra D3, magnesium vitamin C zinc and NAC. I have taken well above and beyond that to experiment and have repaired multiple illnesses, but when the time comes and everything is better I will stop supplementing  because I no longer need it. It is also good to understand the symptoms of the ailment and if it returns to know when to start supplementing again.

I'm looking for some guidance on supplements that could help improve my overall health and potentially contribute to a longer, healthier life.

My current situation:

* I work a sedentary desk job for 8 hours a day.
* I also have a 2-hour round trip car commute daily.
* My current supplement routine is pretty basic: fish oil and Vitamin D (both from Lidl) in the morning.
* I'm 162cm (approx 5'4"") and weigh 80kg (approx 176 lbs). I do track my calories using an app (the one starting with a Y) and try to manage my intake, even when I occasionally eat out.

A significant motivator for this is a recent and major bereavement in my family. It's made me think a lot about my own health and wanting to do what I can to be around for my loved ones for as long and as healthily as possible.

Given my lifestyle (quite a bit of sitting) and goals, are there any particular supplements you would recommend I look into? I'm open to suggestions that could support general well-being, energy levels (without stimulants if possible, given the long days), and long-term health.",Sirman13,1746605391.0,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kgs1rd/seeking_supplement_advice_for_longevity_and/

I only add more if my diet/sleep/exercise is subpar. Creatine (5-10g) is borderline a core supplement for me, so is occasional dosing of niacin (I may be an overmethylator).

btw: nothing truly works without proper sleep, it is so important and a lot of people including myself went years without a night of actual good sleep. The depression alleviation and feeling of everything being novel  afterwards is equal to doing psychedelics, with proper sleep.

Proper mitochondrial function seems to be more important than your neurotransmitter makeup (I don't know THAT much but I am pretty positive it is a requisite for proper neurotransmission/synthesis anyway) and this is regulated best with sleep, not overloading on carbs, and exercise. The creatine and niacin supplement this further. Poor mitochondrial function makes things like the tyrosine not really work well.

Rhodiola Rosea and Methylated B-vitamins + a good diet. 

I don‚Äôt know how often you go for a walk or jogging or running or working out, but just simply getting the body moving can be a better supplement than anything for your mood sometimes also.

As a general rule, with celiacs you need a good supply of fats, lower than normal sugars, and significantly more protein than a typical person would have in order to compensate for absorption issues.

comment,mr0ja5k,1kgo28t,8,,,0,"CREATINE MONOHYDRATE. Holy fuck that shit is MAGIC.


I started Creatine because it came free with my whey protein but I had no idea how insane the mental benefits are. I have had MDD, anxiety and BPD in the past for 5+ years, well I still might have but I tapered and stopped the medications 3 years ago.


(I'm a doctor, stopping my meds was a necessity. It messed up with my experience of life. Everything seemed very muddled and as if there was a curtain before me that filtered everything that came to me, I was just going through the motions of life without living it.) 


I had a breakdown around my friends when we were drunk, regarding life and its meaning etc. I wasn't that depressed but just more troubled mentally by all of it plus I had met my friends after a long fucking time. I had no idea this supplement would help me pick myself up so fucking fast after that  ....



I'm preparing for my postgraduate entrance exam which is very tough and I've been on creatine for 3 months or more I guess. Sleep deprivation does not affect me much now. Mental fatigue is reduced by 50 percent, sleeping a lot better. Depressive thoughts? It's like I can't even think like that even if I force myself to.


I'm gonna consume creatine my whole life now. I'd advise caution though, it shows varying results in different individuals, some get insomnia and brain fog as well. Also in rare cases it can exacerbate or trigger mania in patients with BPD. I started consuming only 1.5 g in the 1st week for the same reason and now limit myself to 3g per day.",BlackDoug420,1746592951.0,,,,
comment,mr0pbim,1kgo28t,5,,,0,"*Here's a short list that I compiled of supplements that have clinical evidence supporting their efficacy:* 

L Theanine and magnesium, as you know!

Ashwagandha: An adaptogenic herb that has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety by regulating cortisol levels. 

Omega-3 fatty acids: Like with depression, omega-3s have been shown to support brain health and reduce symptoms of anxiety.

Valerian root: Often used as a sleep aid, it can also help reduce anxiety and promote a sense of calm. It's kinda sedating in my experience though so be careful driving etc.

GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid): As a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, GABA supplements may help promote a calming effect, but to my understanding the evidence is mixed on how well they cross the blood-brain barrier.

Lavender oil or supplements have been shown to reduce anxiety, improve sleep, and promote an overall sense of calm.

*For depression relief, the following have some clinical evidence that supports their efficacy:*

Omega-3 fatty acids again have been shown to support brain health and improve mood overall. 

Vitamin D: Low levels have been linked to depression, and supplementation can help, especially in those who are deficient.

SAM-e (S-adenosylmethionine): A naturally occurring compound that has been shown to have antidepressant effects. I have personally used it and it had a noticeable uplifting effect on my mood. 

St. John's Wort: A herbal remedy used for mild to moderate depression, though it can interact with many medications, so be careful! It has an SSRI-like effect. 

And B vitamins (especially B6, B9, and B12) are important for brain function and can support mood regulation.",ProfessorSwagamuffin,1746596009.0,,,,

 Magnesium glycinate but i cant stress how important it is to pair it with potassium. Super high dose potassium is everything unless you medically cant tolerate it.

comment,mr353dv,1kgo28t,1,,,0,"Ive been high strung my whole life (rumination, anxiety, intensity). Retired and made a commitment to learning how to totally enjoy a day with none of that. I gotta say it still gets activated but its 80% better. Ive been able to calm things down and just have a much better sense of well being. Been taking and experimenting with supplements but they didnt seem to help that much.  So I threw the industrial sink at it:

- 60 min of exercise per day weights, high intensity exercise, zone 2 cardio
- diet of reduced carbs. Not eliminated but under probably 50 to 60 grams per day
- increased protein intake to 110 grams per day which was a 30 to 40% increase
- added 5 mg lithium oratate daily
- went from sleeping 6 hours a night to 7 and sometimes 8 hours per
- dedicated 20 minutes per day (in the beginning i did 2 20 min sessions per day of resonant breathing (4 seconds in thru nose 6 seconds out per mouth)
- at least 30 min per day outside. Usually in early morning
- when im outside im often on my deck in the morning and i do some yoga at least 4-5 times per week
- renewed my commitment to be an outwardly loving, and supporting spouse, parent and grandpa
- learned to change my expectations about shit or really just remove them. This was easier than i thought. You just realize they are hallucinations and you should stop doing that. Helps you take what comes or kick the bad shit down the road

I think its like every other complex situation - rarely one thing, often the interaction of many things 

Exercise, diet change and breathing practice seem to be the top most controllable things. Sleep critical but sometimes my body just wants to get up and enjoy the day. 

Ps 1 i know: helps that im retired but if i knew back then what i know now i would have done anything to find the time. What could be more important or more productive?

For under-methylators, supplementing creatine helps unburden the methylation cycle, as making creatine use up to 40-45% of SAMe (S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine), the main methylation output.

I really don't know. The protein powder is under $40 per kilo, 24g protein per serve. Doesn't seem to contain shitty fillers or additives. But it doesn't make sense, because other brands are usually double that. Some other Australian companies sell their protein for $80 to $90 per kilo with only slightly increased protein per serve. Even big brands sell their protein for $50 to $55 a kilo.

I've only had good experiences with BN but it got me thinking about the price.

Everyone is different.  You need to find out what works well for you. Some people feel terrible taking the bisglycinate form.

If you don't find health using bisglycinate, there are other forms. Food naturally offers many forms, not one. One form is bound to chlorophyll. Eat chlorophyll, and you are eating magnesium.

I'm in the early stages of a full life transformation.  
Late 30s, male, \~180cm, recently overcame long-term addictions (nicotine, alcohol, stimulants). A few months clean now. I‚Äôm getting serious about rebuilding from the inside out ‚Äî physically, mentally, emotionally.

Naturally athletic but I‚Äôve put on some weight during the lowest period. Starting a structured training plan: **lifting + rowing + Bikram yoga**. My goals are:

* **Body recomposition** (fat loss + muscle gain)
* **Mental clarity, mood regulation**
* **Sleep restoration**
* **Skin & hair repair (I aged very little, I have naturally very high collagen)**
* **Long-term detox + organ support**

I‚Äôve spent months researching and put together this **supplement plan**. It‚Äôs designed to support neurotransmitter repair, gut health, inflammation reduction, fascia/skin support, and sleep ‚Äî without going overboard.

Would *really* appreciate your **critical and informed feedback**, both on:

* Overall safety
* Effectiveness
* Redundancy
* Dosing/timing
* Sobriety alignment

comment,mr06clm,1kg9ou3,2,,,0,"First off, congrats on the sobriety and your focus on improvement.

But as the first reply mentions- we need to know more. What is your diet like? It‚Äôs best to start there and then build out as minimally as possible with supplements.

For neurotransmitter recovery (and likely dopamine recovery), starting with a solid diet and a good exercise plan is going to be the biggest lever. You‚Äôre on a good track to support glutathione, and there are even better options than  nac in that regard.

Adding alcar would be one of the best options that you don‚Äôt have listed here- It can be huge for improving your dopamine baseline and receptor sensitivity. You have choline listed and it pairs well with that.

Lastly, I‚Äôd add a solid dose of theanine before bed, along with magnesium and the glycine or a collagen powder. That combo will help significantly with deep sleep and cortisol regulation.

Besides those, you could really trim a lot of this down and minimize it all. I know you mentioned not minding a strict protocol, but sometimes less is more and it does bring the potential to burn you out even if you are dedicated.",Forward-Nutrition,1746587436.0,,,,

I‚Äôve found there‚Äôs no supplement than can match a solid hour of intense physical exercise. You can always add a bit of melatonin, valerian, or an anti-histamine like diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine, but those aren‚Äôt really long-term solutions the way an essential like exercise is.

comment,mqwka8m,1kg34nf,4,,,0,"Remember, sleep is a complex interaction of the physiological and psychological.

So much of it will come down to understanding how to set yourself up in both aspects for quality sleep.

I have a cheap, basic sleep protocol for myself and my clients that hits both:

1. 1-1.5 hrs b4 bed take magnesium, l-theanine, melatonin, GABA, maybe some 5htp (if not on antidepressants). Lemon balm, glycine, kava kava, etc are all additional adds if needed. Apollon Nutrition From Dusk til Dawn is a well dosed supplement. If really intense stress, maybe some phosphatidylserine. This pushes on the right neurotransmitters that start the cascade for calming the nervous system and setting you up for a less ""heightened state""
2. 1 hr before bed, use, blue light-blocking glasses and brain dump, plan next day, etc. This has helped me personally a TON. I have struggled with ADHD and anxiety and just getting everything off my brain - ""EMPTY THE MENTAL RAM."" Talking to your phone, dog, writing it down, etc- all work. This drives on the psychological portion.
3. 30-45 min before bed, turn off lights and use only red lights in bedroom and bathroom to take shower, brush teeth, etc.

The red lights (I just use cheap red light nightlights from AMAZON ) do wonders for calming the nervous system. That plus the shower that warms you up then forces your body to cools (helping with sleep) finishes it off.

4. SLEEP :)

This has helped so many of my clients (and myself) people and obviously can be tailored more if needed, but Id start here and go from there!",jackednleen,1746547022.0,,,,

The best time of day to take magnesium L-threonate depends on your goals:

‚∏ª

For brain health, focus, and cognitive support:
	‚Ä¢	Morning or early afternoon
	‚Ä¢	Helps improve mental clarity and focus during the day
	‚Ä¢	May support learning and memory if taken consistently

‚∏ª

For relaxation, sleep, or reducing evening anxiety:
	‚Ä¢	1‚Äì2 hours before bedtime
	‚Ä¢	It crosses the blood-brain barrier and can have a calming effect
	‚Ä¢	Often taken as part of a nighttime wind-down routine

‚Äî‚Äî

As for me, I take it in the morning when I wake up, and again in the mid-day or early afternoon.

I take magnesium glycinate at bed time.

- Solgar chelated magnesium 100mg per tablet 
- Solgar ferrous bisglycinate iron 20mg per tablet 
- Solgar skin nails and hair supplement which has MSM(1000mg), red algae(l-calcareum 150mg), Vit C (120mg),l-lysine (50mg), l-proline(50mg), zinc citrate (15mg), copper bisglycinate (2mg) per 2 tablets.


I am a 26yo female, slightly low iron levels on my blood tests and can't seem to get enough through my diet.


I eat yogurt for breakfast so the calcium  in it might interfere with the iron and usually eat meat and veggies rich in Vit C for dinner.


Would that mean I should take the magnesium with my breakfast and the iron with my dinner for best absorption? All the advice I see is to take the iron in the morning on empty stomach and the magnesium in the evening.



Alsp should I take the skin hair and nail tablet with the magnesium rather than with the iron as it has l-calcareum?

Finally should I take them with food or on empty stomach? The bottles say ""preferably with food""

submission,1kfsyee,,0,Can someone help me which vitamin/nutrient could be causing my nausea?,0.25,,"Long story short, I've been testing three multivitamins. Only one out of three of the multivitamins does not give me nausea but other two do. So it would be a good control and comparison to rule out what could be nausea causing vitamins/nutrients. I am suspecting one of the B vitamins but just need a second opinion. I've tested each multivitamin multiple times and i've gotten consistent results that only Ener-C does not nauseate while the other two do.

  
The supplement that does not cause me nausea is the Ener-C sachets. Nutrition facts: [https://www.ener-life.com/cdn/shop/products/Ener-C\_Supplement\_Facts\_SF\_MB-01.jpg?v=1725038765](https://www.ener-life.com/cdn/shop/products/Ener-C_Supplement_Facts_SF_MB-01.jpg?v=1725038765)

The other two are below.

AOR Multi basics 3 which gives me mild nausea if taken every day. Little to no nausea if taken every other day. This multivitamin is supposed to be taken 3 times a day but I only take once a day. Nutrition facts under ""Supplement facts"": [https://aor.ca/product/multi-basics-3/?srsltid=AfmBOoo0kYJbpIRudGA-ZsFun9gUD0Aai7FwRGgjZWkChgKUknXKubXn](https://aor.ca/product/multi-basics-3/?srsltid=AfmBOoo0kYJbpIRudGA-ZsFun9gUD0Aai7FwRGgjZWkChgKUknXKubXn)

  
Thorne Basic B complex which gives me the most nausea if taken every day: [https://d1vo8zfysxy97v.cloudfront.net/media/product/b104\_s04\_v1523f53f7b0f9df7f7449eba82be98cece9af1bf.png](https://d1vo8zfysxy97v.cloudfront.net/media/product/b104_s04_v1523f53f7b0f9df7f7449eba82be98cece9af1bf.png)

I am suspecting the high amounts of certain B-vitamins like B5, B6, B3 that aren't found as much in Ener-C.  The other thing I can think is the method of intake. Ener-C taken as a powder in water disperses more evenly and dilutes contact with GI lining might be more tolerable than the capsules themselves. What are your thoughts? And any recommendations. I do want to take the other two brands since they contain methylated forms of b vitamins but this nausea is not helping.  


P.s. I take all multivitamins with fatty food as well.
